  <p>It's worth taking time to appreciate just how amazingly well we are able to
  perform tasks with our hands.  Tasks that often feel mundane to us -- loading
  the dishwasher, chopping vegetables, folding laundry -- remain as incredibly
  challenging tasks for robots and are at the very forefront of robotics
  research.</p>
    
  <todo>Can I do an illustration of the dish task with a human, ala
  alberto/francois artwork?  https://fhogan.github.io/img/hybrid_behavior.png
  </todo>
  
  <p>Consider the problem of picking up a single plate from a stack of plates in
  the sink and placing it into the dishwasher.  Clearly you first have to
  perceive that there is a plate in the sink and that it is accessible. Getting
  your hand to the plate likely requires navigating your hand around the
  geometry of the sink and other dishes.  The act of actually picking it up
  might require a fairly subtle maneuver where you have to tip up the plate,
  sliding it along your fingers and then along the sink/dishes in order to get a
  reasonable grasp on it.  Presumably as you lift it out of the sink, you'd like
  to mostly avoid collisions between the plate and the sink, which suggests a
  reasonable understanding of the size/extent of the plate (though I actually
  think robots today are too afraid of collisions).  Even placing the plate into
  the dishwasher is pretty subtle.  You might think that you would align the
  plate with the slats and then slide it in, but I think humans are more clever
  than that.  A seemingly better strategy is to loosen your grip on the plate,
  come in at an angle and intentionally contact one side of the slat, letting
  the plate effectively rotate itself into position as you set it down.  But the
  justification for this strategy is subtle -- it is a way to achieve the
  kinematically accurate task without requiring much kinematic accuracy on the
  position/orientation of the plate.</p>

  <p>Perhaps one of the reasons that these problems remain so hard is that they
  require strong capabilities in numerous technical areas that have
  traditionally been somewhat disparate; it's challenging to be an expert in all
  of them.  More so than robotic mapping and navigation, or legged locomotion,
  or other great areas in robotics, the most interesting problems in
  manipulation require significant interactions between perception, planning,
  and control. This includes both geometric perception to understand the local
  geometry of the objects and environment and semantic perception to understand
  what opportunities for manipulation are available in the scene. Planning
  typically includes reasoning about the kinematic and dynamic constraints of
  the task (how do I command my rigid seven degree-of-freedom arm to reach into
  the drawer?).  But it also includes higher-level task planning (to get milk
  into my cup, I need to open the fridge, then grab the bottle, then unscrew the
  lid, then pour... and perhaps even put it all back when I'm done).  The
  low-level begs for representations using real numbers, but the higher levels
  feel more logical and discrete.  At perhaps the lowest level, our hands are
  making and breaking contact with the world either directly or through tools,
  exerting forces, rapidly and easily transitioning between sticking and sliding
  frictional regimes -- these alone are incredibly rich and difficult problems
  from the perspective of dynamics and control.</p>
  
    
  <p>There is a lot for us to discuss!</p>
  
  <!-- two core research problems (that I like to focus on): 1) there are many
  tasks that we don't know how to program a robot to do robustly even in a
  single instance in lab (reach into your pocket and pull out the keys); 2)
  achieving robustness of a complete manipulation stack in the open-world. -->
  
  <section><h1>Manipulation is more than pick-and-place</h1>
  
    <p>There are a large number of applications for manipulation.  Picking up an
    object from one bin and placing it into another bin -- one version of the
    famous "pick and place" problem -- is a great application for robotic
    manipulation.  Robots have done this for decades in factories with carefully
    curated parts.  In the last few years, we've seen a new generation of
    pick-and-place systems that use deep learning for perception, and can work
    well with much more diverse sets of objects, especially if the
    location/orientation of the placement need not be very accurate.  This can
    be done with conventional robot hands or more special-purpose end-effectors
    that, for instance, use suction.  It can often be done without having a very
    accurate understanding of the shape, pose, mass, nor friction of the
    object(s) to be picked.</p>
  
    <p>The goal for these notes, however, is to examine the much broader view of
    manipulation than what is captured by the pick and place problem.  Even our
    thought experiment of loading the dishwasher -- arguably a more advanced
    type of pick and place -- requires much more from the perception, planning,
    and control systems.  But the diversity of tasks that humans (and hopefully
    soon robots) can do with their hands is truly remarkable.  To see one small
    catalog of examples that I like, take a look at the
    <a href="http://www.shap.ecs.soton.ac.uk/about-usage.php?task=buttons/">
    Southampton Hand Assessment Procedure (SHAP)</a>, which was designed as a
    way to empirically evaluate prosthetic hands.  Matt Mason also gave a broad
    and thoughtful definition of manipulation in the opening of his 2018 review
    paper<elib>Mason18</elib>.</p>
      
    <p>It's also important to recognize that manipulation research today looks
    very different than manipulation research looked like in the 1980s and
    1990s.  During that time there was a strong and beautiful focus on
    "manipulation as grasping," with seminal work on, for instance, the
    kinematics/dynamics of multi-fingered hands assuming a stable grasp on an
    object.  Sometimes still, I hear people use the term "grasping" as almost
    synonymous with manipulation.  But please realize that the goals of
    manipulation research today, and of these notes, are much broader than that.
    Is grasping a sufficient description of what your hand is doing when you are
    buttoning your shirt?  Making a salad?  Spreading peanut butter on
    toast?</p>
  
  </section>  
  
  <section><h1>Open-world manipulation</h1>
    
    <p>Perhaps because humans are so good at manipulation, our expectations in
    terms of performance and robustness for these tasks are extremely high.
    It's not enough to be able to load one set of plates in a laboratory
    environment into a dishwasher reliably.  We'd like to be able to manipulate
    basically any plate that someone might put in the sink.  And we'd like the
    system to be able to work in any kitchen, despite various geometric
    configurations, lighting conditions, etc.  The challenge of achieving and
    verifying robustness of a complex manipulation stack with physics,
    perception, planning, and control in the loop is already daunting.  But how
    do we provide test coverage for every kitchen in the world?</p>
  
    <p>The idea that the world has infinite variability (there will never be a
    point at which you have seen every possible kitchen) is often referred to as
    the "open-world" or "open-domain" problem -- a term popularized first in the
    context of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_world">video
    games</a>.  It can be tough to strike a balance between rigorous thinking
    about aspects of the manipulation problem, and trying to embrace the
    diversity and complexity of the entire world.  But it's important to walk
    that line.</p>
  
    <p>There is chance that diversity of manipulation in the open world might
    actually make the problem easier.  We are just at the dawn of the era of big
    data in robotics; the impact this will have cannot be overstated.  But I
    think it is deeper than that.  As an example, some of our optimization
    formulations for planning and control might get stuck in local minima now
    because narrow problem formulations can have many quirky solutions; but once
    we ask a controller to work in a huge diversity of scenarios then the quirky
    solutions can be discarded and the optimization landscape may become much
    simpler.  But to the extent that is true, then we should aim to understand
    it rigorously!</p>
  </section>
  
  <section><h1>Simulation</h1>
      
    <p>There is another reason that we are now entering a golden age for
    manipulation research.  Our software tools have (very recently) gotten much
    better!</p>
      
    <p>It was only about three years ago that I remember talking to my students,
    who were all quite adept at using simulation for developing control systems
    for walking robots, about using simulation for manipulation.  "You can't
    work on manipulation in simulation" was their refrain, and for good reason.
    The complexity of the contact mechanics in manipulation has traditionally
    been much harder to simulate than a walking robot that only interacts with
    the ground and through a minimal set of contact points.  Looming even
    larger, though, was the centrality of perception for manipulation; it was
    generally accepted that one could not simulate a camera well enough to be
    meaningful.</p>
      
    <p>How quickly things can change!  The last few years has seen a rapid
    adoption of video-game quality rendering by the robotics and computer vision
    communities.  The growing consensus now is that game-engine renderers
    <i>can</i> model cameras well enough not only to <i>test</i> a perception
    system in simulation, but even to <i>train</i> perception systems in
    simulation and expect them to work in the real world!  This is fairly
    amazing, as we were all very concerned before that training a deep learning
    perception system in simulation would allow it to exploit any quirks of the
    simulated images that could make the problem easier.</p>
      
    <p>We have also seen dramatic improvements in the quality and performance of
    contact simulation.  Making robust and performant simulations of multi-body
    contact involves dealing with complex geometry queries and stiff (measure-)
    differential equations.  There is still room for fundamental improvements in
    the mathematical formulations of the governing equations, but today's
    solvers are good enough to be extremely useful.</p>
      
</section>
    
<section><h1>These notes are interactive</h1>
    
    <p>By leveraging the power of simulation, and the new availability of free
    online interactive compute, I am trying to make these notes more than what
    you would find in a traditional text.  Each chapter will have working code
    examples, which you can run immediately (no installation required) on <a
    href="https://colab.research.google.com/">Google's Colaboratory</a>, or
    download/install and run on your local machine (see the <a
    href="drake.html">appendix</a> for more details).  It uses an open-source
    library called <drake></drake> which has been a labor of love for me over
    the last 7 years or so.  Because all of the code is open source, it is
    entirely up to you how deep into the rabbit hole you choose to go.</p>
    
    <p>Mortimer Adler famously said "Reading a [great] book should be a
    conversation between you and the author." In addition to the interactive
    graphics/code, I've added the ability to highlight/comment/ask questions
    directly on these notes (go ahead and try it; but please read my note on <a
    href="misc.html#annotation">annotation etiquette</a>).  Adler's suggestion
    was that
    <i>great</i> writing can turn static text into a dialogue, transcending
    distance and time; perhaps I'm cheating, but technology can help me
    communicate with you even if my writing isn't as strong as Adler would have
    liked!</p>
      
    <p>I have organized the software examples into notebooks by chapter.  There
    is an "Open in Colab" button at the top of each chapter; I'd encourage you
    to open it immediately when you are reading the chapter and run the
    first cell, which takes up to two minutes to provision the cloud machine.
    Then as you read the text, I will have examples that will have corresponding
    sections in the notebook.</p>
      
    <example><h1>Teleoperation in 3D.</h1>
      
      <p>Before we get into any autonomous manipulation, let's start by just
      getting a feel for what it will be like to work on manipulation in an
      online Jupyter notebook.  This example will open up a new window with our
      3D visualizer, and in the original notebook it has sliders that you can
      use to drive the end-effector of the robot around.  Give it a spin!</p>

  <section><h1>Model-based design and analysis</h1>
    
    <p>Thanks to progress in simulation, it is now possible to pursue a
    meaningful study of manipulation without needing a physical robot.  But
    simulation (of our robot dynamics, sensors, actuators and its environment)
    is not enough.  Another major challenge in manipulation is the potential
    number and complexity of autonomy components (perception, planning, and
    control) that we need to assemble in order to do the tasks.  A major goal
    of these notes is to attempt to bridle this complexity, to the extent
    possible.</p>
      
    <p>Many of you will be familiar with <a href="http://ros.org">ROS (the Robot
    Operating System)</a>.  I believe that ROS was one of the best things to
    happen to robotics in the last decade.  It meant that experts from different
    subdisciplines could easily share their expertise in the form of modular
    components.  Components (as ROS packages) simply agree on the messages that
    they will send and receive on the network; packages can inter-operate even
    if they are written in different programming languages or even on different
    operating systems.</p>

    <p>Although ROS makes it relatively easy to get started with manipulation,
    it doesn't serve my pedagogical goal of thinking clearly about
    manipulation.  The modular approach to authoring the components is extremely
    good, and we will adopt it here.  But in <drake></drake> we ask for a little
    bit more from each of the components -- essentially that they declare their
    states, parameters, and timing semantics in a consistent way -- so that we
    have a much better chance of understanding the complex relationships between
    systems.  This has great practical value as well; the ability to debug a
    full manipulation stack with repeatable deterministic simulations (even if
    they include randomness) is surprisingly rare in the field but hugely
    valuable.</p>
      
    <p>The key building block in our work will be <drake></drake>
    <b>Systems</b>, and systems can be combined in complex combinations into
    <b>Diagrams</b>.  System diagrams have long been the modeling paradigm used
    in controls, and the software aspect of it will be very familiar to you if
    you've used tools like Simulink, LabView, or Modelica.  These software tools
    refer to the block-diagram design paradigm as "model-based design".</p>
    
    <example><h1>System Diagrams</h1>
        
        <p>Even the examples above, which relied on you to perform teleoperation
        instead of having an autonomy stack, were still the result of combining
        numerous parts.  For any system (a system diagram is still a system)
        that you have in <drake></drake>, you can visualize that diagram
        directly in the notebook.</p>
        
        <iframe width="100%" height="300px" src="https://people.csail.mit.edu/russt/uploads/manip_station.html"></iframe>
        <todo>Update this to the newer rendering, and host the file in
        manipulation/data.</todo>
        
        <p>This graphic is interactive.  Make sure you zoom in and click around
        to get a sense for the amount of complexity that we can abstract away in
        this framework.  For instance, try expanding the
        <code>iiwa_controller</code> block.</p>
        
        <p>Whenever you are ready to learn more about the Systems Framework in
        <drake></drake>, I recommend starting with the "Modeling Dynamical
        Systems" tutorial linked from the <a href="http://drake.mit.edu">main
        Drake website</a>.</p>
        
    </example>

    <p>Let me be transparent: not everybody likes this systems framework.  Some
    people are just trying to move fast, and don't see the benefits of slowing
    down to declare their state variables, etc.  It will likely feel like a
    burden to you the first time you go to write a new system.  But it's
    precisely <i>because</i> we're trying to build complex systems quickly that
    I advocate this more rigorous approach.  I believe that getting to the next
    level of maturity in our open-world manipulation system requires more
    maturity from our building blocks.</p>
        
  </section> 
  
  <section><h1>Organization of these notes</h1>
  
    <p>The remaining chapters of these notes are organized around the
    component-level building blocks of manipulation.  Many of these components
    each individually build on a wealth of literature (e.g. from computer
    vision, or dynamics and control).  Rather than be overwhelmed, I've chosen
    to focus on delivering a consistent coherent presentation of the most
    relevant ideas from each field <i>as they relate to manipulation</i>, and
    pointers to more literature.  Even finding a single notation across all of
    the fields can be a challenge!</p>
        
    <p>The next few chapters will give you a minimal background on the relevant
    robot hardware that we are simulating, on (some of) the details about
    simulating them, and on the geometry and kinematics basics that we will use
    heavily through the notes.</p>
        
    <p>For the remainder of the notes, rather than organize the chapters into
    "Perception", "Planning", and "Control", I've decided to spiral through
    these topics.  In the first part, we'll do just enough perception, planning,
    and control to build up a basic manipulation system that can perform
    pick-and-place manipulation of known isolated objects.  Then I'll try to
    motivate each new chapter by describing what our previous system cannot do,
    and what we hope it will do by the end of the chapter.</p>
      
    <p>I welcome any feedback.  And don't forget to interact!</p>
      
<!--      
    <p>One thing that we’ll leave out is humans.  It’s not that I don’t like humans, but we have enough to do here without trying to model them.  Let’s call it future work.  The one exception is when we talk about control of the arm — a few simple heuristics at this level can make the robots much safer if operating around humans.  The robot won’t understand them, but we want to make sure we still don’t hurt them.  Or other robots/agents in the scene.</p>
