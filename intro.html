<chapter style="counter-reset: chapter 0"><h1>Introduction</h1>
    
  <p>It's worth taking time to appreciate just how amazingly well we are able to
  perform tasks with our hands.  Tasks that often feel mundane to us -- loading
  the dishwasher, chopping vegetables, folding laundry -- remain as incredibly
  challenging tasks for robots and are at the very forefront of robotics
  research.</p>
    
  <figure><span title="Artwork by Reed Alspach"><img style="width:24%" src="data/plate_pick_final_3.JPG"/>&nbsp;<img style="width:24%" src="data/plate_pick_final_4.JPG"/>&nbsp;<img style="width:24%" src="data/plate_pick_final_5.JPG"/>&nbsp;<img style="width:24%" src="data/plate_pick_final_6.JPG">  </span>
  </figure>
  
  <p>Consider the problem of picking up a single plate from a stack of plates in
  the sink and placing it into the dishwasher.  Clearly you first have to
  perceive that there is a plate in the sink and that it is accessible. Getting
  your hand to the plate likely requires navigating your hand around the
  geometry of the sink and other dishes.  The act of actually picking it up
  might require a fairly subtle maneuver where you have to tip up the plate,
  sliding it along your fingers and then along the sink/dishes in order to get a
  reasonable grasp on it.  Presumably as you lift it out of the sink, you'd like
  to mostly avoid collisions between the plate and the sink, which suggests a
  reasonable understanding of the size/extent of the plate (though I actually
  think robots today are too afraid of collisions).  Even placing the plate into
  the dishwasher is pretty subtle.  You might think that you would align the
  plate with the slats and then slide it in, but I think humans are more clever
  than that.  A seemingly better strategy is to loosen your grip on the plate,
  come in at an angle and intentionally contact one side of the slat, letting
  the plate effectively rotate itself into position as you set it down.  But the
  justification for this strategy is subtle -- it is a way to achieve the
  kinematically accurate task without requiring much kinematic accuracy on the
  position/orientation of the plate.</p>

  </figure>
    
  <p>Perhaps one of the reasons that these problems remain so hard is that they
  require strong capabilities in numerous technical areas that have
  traditionally been somewhat disparate; it's challenging to be an expert in all
  of them.  More so than robotic mapping and navigation, or legged locomotion,
  or other great areas in robotics, the most interesting problems in
  manipulation require significant interactions between perception, planning,
  and control. This includes both geometric perception to understand the local
  geometry of the objects and environment and semantic perception to understand
  what opportunities for manipulation are available in the scene. Planning
  typically includes reasoning about the kinematic and dynamic constraints of
  the task (how do I command my rigid seven degree-of-freedom arm to reach into
  the drawer?).  But it also includes higher-level task planning (to get milk
  into my cup, I need to open the fridge, then grab the bottle, then unscrew the
  lid, then pour... and perhaps even put it all back when I'm done).  The
  low-level begs for representations using real numbers, but the higher levels
  feel more logical and discrete.  At perhaps the lowest level, our hands are
  making and breaking contact with the world either directly or through tools,
  exerting forces, rapidly and easily transitioning between sticking and sliding
  frictional regimes -- these alone are incredibly rich and difficult problems
  from the perspective of dynamics and control.</p>
  
    
  <p>There is a lot for us to discuss!</p>
  
  <!-- two core research problems (that I like to focus on): 1) there are many
  tasks that we don't know how to program a robot to do robustly even in a
  single instance in lab (reach into your pocket and pull out the keys); 2)
  achieving robustness of a complete manipulation stack in the open-world. -->
  
  <section><h1>Manipulation is more than pick-and-place</h1>
  
    <p>There are a large number of applications for manipulation.  Picking up an
    object from one bin and placing it into another bin -- one version of the
    famous "pick and place" problem -- is a great application for robotic
    manipulation.  Robots have done this for decades in factories with carefully
    curated parts.  In the last few years, we've seen a new generation of
    pick-and-place systems that use deep learning for perception, and can work
    well with much more diverse sets of objects, especially if the
    location/orientation of the placement need not be very accurate.  This can
    be done with conventional robot hands or more special-purpose end-effectors
    that, for instance, use suction.  It can often be done without having a very
    accurate understanding of the shape, pose, mass, nor friction of the
    object(s) to be picked.</p>
  
    <p>The goal for these notes, however, is to examine the much broader view of
    manipulation than what is captured by the pick and place problem.  Even our
    thought experiment of loading the dishwasher -- arguably a more advanced
    type of pick and place -- requires much more from the perception, planning,
    and control systems.  But the diversity of tasks that humans (and hopefully
    soon robots) can do with their hands is truly remarkable.  To see one small
    catalog of examples that I like, take a look at the
    <a href="http://www.shap.ecs.soton.ac.uk/about-usage.php?task=buttons/">
    Southampton Hand Assessment Procedure (SHAP)</a>, which was designed as a
    way to empirically evaluate prosthetic hands.  Matt Mason also gave a broad
    and thoughtful definition of manipulation in the opening of his 2018 review
    paper<elib>Mason18</elib>.</p>
      
    <p>It's also important to recognize that manipulation research today looks
    very different than manipulation research looked like in the 1980s and
    1990s.  During that time there was a strong and beautiful focus on
    "manipulation as grasping," with seminal work on, for instance, the
    kinematics/dynamics of multi-fingered hands assuming a stable grasp on an
    object.  Sometimes still, I hear people use the term "grasping" as almost
    synonymous with manipulation.  But please realize that the goals of
    manipulation research today, and of these notes, are much broader than that.
    Is grasping a sufficient description of what your hand is doing when you are
    buttoning your shirt?  Making a salad?  Spreading peanut butter on
    toast?</p>
  
  </section>  
  
  <section><h1>Open-world manipulation</h1>
    
    <p>Perhaps because humans are so good at manipulation, our expectations in
    terms of performance and robustness for these tasks are extremely high.
    It's not enough to be able to load one set of plates in a laboratory
    environment into a dishwasher reliably.  We'd like to be able to manipulate
    basically any plate that someone might put in the sink.  And we'd like the
    system to be able to work in any kitchen, despite various geometric
    configurations, lighting conditions, etc.  The challenge of achieving and
    verifying robustness of a complex manipulation stack with physics,
    perception, planning, and control in the loop is already daunting.  But how
    do we provide test coverage for every kitchen in the world?</p>
  
    <p>The idea that the world has infinite variability (there will never be a
    point at which you have seen every possible kitchen) is often referred to as
    the "open-world" or "open-domain" problem -- a term popularized first in the
    context of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_world">video
    games</a>.  It can be tough to strike a balance between rigorous thinking
    about aspects of the manipulation problem, and trying to embrace the
    diversity and complexity of the entire world.  But it's important to walk
    that line.</p>
  
    <p>There is a chance that the diversity of manipulation in the open world
    might actually make the problem easier.  We are just at the dawn of the era
    of big data in robotics; the impact this will have cannot be overstated.
    But I think it is deeper than that.  As an example, some of our
    optimization formulations for planning and control might get stuck in local
    minima now because narrow problem formulations can have many quirky
    solutions; but once we ask a controller to work in a huge diversity of
    scenarios then the quirky solutions can be discarded and the optimization
    landscape may become much simpler.  But to the extent that is true, then we
    should aim to understand it rigorously!</p>
  </section>
  
  <section><h1>Simulation</h1>
      
    <p>There is another reason that we are now entering a golden age for
    manipulation research.  Our software tools have (very recently) gotten much
    better!</p>
      
    <p>I remember a just few years ago (~2015) talking to my PhD students, who
    were all quite adept at using simulation for developing control systems for
    walking robots, about using simulation for manipulation.  "You can't work
    on manipulation in simulation" was their refrain, and for good reason. The
    complexity of the contact mechanics in manipulation has traditionally been
    much harder to simulate than a walking robot that only interacts with the
    ground and through a minimal set of contact points.  Looming even larger,
    though, was the centrality of perception for manipulation; it was generally
    accepted that one could not simulate a camera well enough to be
    meaningful.</p>
      
    <p>How quickly things can change!  The last few years has seen a rapid
    adoption of video-game quality rendering by the robotics and computer vision
    communities.  The growing consensus now is that game-engine renderers
    <i>can</i> model cameras well enough not only to <i>test</i> a perception
    system in simulation, but even to <i>train</i> perception systems in
    simulation and expect them to work in the real world!  This is fairly
    amazing, as we were all very concerned before that training a deep learning
    perception system in simulation would allow it to exploit any quirks of the
    simulated images that could make the problem easier.</p>
      
    <p>We have also seen dramatic improvements in the quality and performance
    of contact simulation.  Making robust and performant simulations of
    multi-body contact involves dealing with complex geometry queries and stiff
    (measure-) differential equations.  There is still room for fundamental
    improvements in the mathematical formulations of and numerical solutions
    for the governing equations, but today's solvers are good enough to be
    extremely useful.</p>
      
</section>
    
<section><h1>These notes are interactive</h1>
    
    <p>By leveraging the power of simulation, and the new availability of free
    online interactive compute, I am trying to make these notes more than what
    you would find in a traditional text.  Each chapter will have working code
    examples, which you can run immediately (no installation required) on <a
    href="https://deepnote.com">Deepnote</a>, or download/install and run on
    your local machine (see the <a href="drake.html">appendix</a> for more
    details).  It uses an open-source library called <drake></drake> which has
    been a labor of love for me since around 2013 when I started taking our
    research code and making it more broadly available. Because all of the code
    is open source, it is entirely up to you how deep into the rabbit hole you
    choose to go.</p>
    
    <p>Mortimer Adler famously said "Reading a [great] book should be a
    conversation between you and the author." In addition to the interactive
    graphics/code, I've added the ability to highlight/comment/ask questions
    directly on these notes (go ahead and try it; but please read my note on <a
    href="misc.html#annotation">annotation etiquette</a>).  Adler's suggestion
    was that <i>great</i> writing can turn static text into a dialogue,
    transcending distance and time; perhaps I'm cheating, but technology can
    help me communicate with you even if my writing isn't as strong as Adler
    would have liked!</p>
      
    <p>I have organized the software examples into notebooks by chapter.  There
    is an "Launch in Deepnote" button at the top of each chapter; I'd encourage
    you to open it immediately when you are reading the chapter.  Go ahead and
    "duplicate" the chapter project and run the first cell to startup the cloud
    machine. Then as you read the text, I will have examples that will have
    corresponding sections in the notebook.</p>
      
    <example id="teleop2d"><h1>Teleoperation in 2D.</h1>
      
      <p>Before we get into any autonomous manipulation, let's start by just
      getting a feel for what it will be like to work on manipulation in an
      online Jupyter notebook.  This example will open up a new window with our
      3D visualizer, and in the "Controls" menu in the visualizer, you will 
      find sliders that you can use to drive the end-effector of the robot 
      around. Give it a spin!</p>

      <script>document.write(notebook_link('intro'))</script>
      
    </example>
            
    <example><h1>Teleoperation in 3D.</h1>
      
      <p>I offered a 2D visualization / control first because everything is simpler in 2D. But the simulation is actually
        running fully in 3D. Run the second example to see it.</p>

      <script>document.write(notebook_link('intro'))</script>
        
    </example>

  </section>
  
  <section><h1>Model-based design and analysis</h1>
    
    <p>Thanks to progress in simulation, it is now possible to pursue a
    meaningful study of manipulation without needing a physical robot.  But the
    software advances in simulation (of our robot dynamics, sensors, actuators
    and its environment) are not enough to support all of the topics in these
    notes.  Manipulation research today leverages a myriad of advanced
    algorithms in perception, planning, and control. In addition to providing
    those individual algorithms, a major goal of these notes is to attempt to
    bridle the complexity of using them together in a systematic way.</p>
      
    <p>Many of you will be familiar with <a href="http://ros.org">ROS (the
    Robot Operating System)</a>.  I believe that ROS was one of the best things
    to happen to robotics in the last decades.  It meant that experts from
    different subdisciplines could easily share their expertise in the form of
    modular components.  Components (as ROS packages) simply agree on the
    messages that they will send and receive on the network; packages can
    inter-operate even if they are written in different programming languages
    or even on different operating systems.</p>

    <p>Although ROS makes it relatively easy to get started with manipulation,
    it doesn't serve my pedagogical goal of thinking clearly about
    manipulation.  The modular approach to authoring the components is extremely
    good, and we will adopt it here.  But in <drake></drake> we ask for a little
    bit more from each of the components -- essentially that they declare their
    states, parameters, and timing semantics in a consistent way -- so that we
    have a much better chance of understanding the complex relationships between
    systems.  This has great practical value as well; the ability to debug a
    full manipulation stack with repeatable deterministic simulations (even if
    they include randomness) is surprisingly rare in the field but hugely
    valuable.</p>
      
    <p>The key building block in our work will be <drake></drake>
    <b>Systems</b>, and systems can be combined in complex combinations into
    <b>Diagrams</b>.  System diagrams have long been the modeling paradigm used
    in controls, and the software aspect of it will be very familiar to you if
    you've used tools like Simulink, LabView, or Modelica.  These software tools
    refer to the block-diagram design paradigm as "model-based design".</p>
    
    <example><h1>System Diagrams</h1>
        
        <p>Even the examples above, which relied on you to perform teleoperation
        instead of having an autonomy stack, were still the result of combining
        numerous parts.  For any system (a system diagram is still a system)
        that you have in <drake></drake>, you can visualize that diagram
        directly in the notebook.</p>
        
        <iframe width="100%" height="300px" src="https://people.csail.mit.edu/russt/uploads/manip_station.html"></iframe>
        <todo>Update this to the newer rendering, and host the file in
        manipulation/data.</todo>
        
        <p>This graphic is interactive.  Make sure you zoom in and click around
        to get a sense for the amount of complexity that we can abstract away in
        this framework.  For instance, try expanding the
        <code>iiwa_controller</code> block.</p>
        
        <p>Whenever you are ready to learn more about the Systems Framework in
        <drake></drake>, I recommend starting with the "Modeling Dynamical
        Systems" tutorial linked from the <a href="http://drake.mit.edu">main
        Drake website</a>.</p>
        
    </example>

    <p>Let me be transparent: not everybody likes this systems framework for
    manipulation.  Some people are just trying to write code as fast as
    possible, and don't see the benefits of slowing down to declare their state
    variables, etc.  It will likely feel like a burden to you the first time
    you go to write a new system.  But it's precisely <i>because</i> we're
    trying to build complex systems quickly that I advocate this more rigorous
    approach.  I believe that getting to the next level of maturity in our
    open-world manipulation systems requires more maturity from our building
    blocks.</p>
        
  </section> 
  
  <section><h1>Organization of these notes</h1>
  
    <p>The remaining chapters of these notes are organized around the
    component-level building blocks of manipulation.  Many of these components
    each individually build on a wealth of literature (e.g. from computer
    vision, or dynamics and control).  Rather than be overwhelmed, I've chosen
    to focus on delivering a consistent coherent presentation of the most
    relevant ideas from each field <i>as they relate to manipulation</i>, and
    pointers to more literature.  Even finding a single notation across all of
    the fields can be a challenge!</p>
        
    <p>The next few chapters will give you a minimal background on the relevant
    robot hardware that we are simulating, on (some of) the details about
    simulating them, and on the geometry and kinematics basics that we will use
    heavily through the notes.</p>
        
    <p>For the remainder of the notes, rather than organize the chapters into
    "Perception", "Planning", and "Control", I've decided to spiral through
    these topics.  In the first part, we'll do just enough perception, planning,
    and control to build up a basic manipulation system that can perform
    pick-and-place manipulation of known isolated objects.  Then I'll try to
    motivate each new chapter by describing what our previous system cannot do,
    and what we hope it will do by the end of the chapter.</p>
      
    <p>I welcome any feedback.  And don't forget to interact!</p>

    <p>One thing that we’ll leave out is humans.  It’s not that I don’t like humans, but we have enough to do here without trying to model them.  Let’s call it future work.  The one exception is when we talk about control of the arm — a few simple heuristics at this level can make the robots much safer if operating around humans.  The robot won’t understand them, but we want to make sure we still don’t hurt them.  Or other robots/agents in the scene.</p>

  <section><h1>Exercises</h1>
  
    <exercise id="drake_exercise"><h1>Familiarize yourself with Drake</h1>

      <p><drake></drake> is a powerful and mature software library that can
      support many advanced robotics applications.  The motivation behind it is
      described <a
      href="https://medium.com/toyotaresearch/drake-model-based-design-in-the-age-of-robotics-and-machine-learning-59938c985515">in
      this blog post</a>.  It is extensively documented, but you have to know
      where to look for it.</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Check out the growing list of <drake></drake> <a
        href="https://github.com/RobotLocomotion/drake/tree/master/tutorials"
        target="_tutorials">tutorials</a> (linked from the main Drake page). In
        the <code>dynamical_systems</code> tutorial, to what value is the
        initial condition, $x(0)$, set when we simulate the
        <code>SimpleContinuousTimeSystem</code>?</li>

        <li>The class-/function-level documentation is the most extensive
        documentation in Drake.  When I'm working on Drake (in either C++ or
        Python), I most often have the <a
        href="https://drake.mit.edu/doxygen_cxx/index.html">C++ doxygen</a>
        open.  The <a href="https://drake.mit.edu/pydrake/index.html">Python
        documentation</a> is (mostly) auto-generated from this and isn't
        curated as carefully; I tend to look there only in the rare cases that
        the Python interface differs from C++.  
        
        <div>In C++ doxygen, search for "Spatial Vectors".  What ascii
        characters do we use to denote an angular acceleration in
        code?</div></li>

        <li>Drake is open-source.  There are no black-box algorithms here.  If
        you ever want to see how a particular algorithm is implemented, or find
        examples of how to use a function, you can always look at the source
        code.  These days you can <a
        href="https://github1s.com/RobotLocomotion/drake" target="_vscode">use
        VS Code</a> to explore the code right in your browser.  What value of 
        <code>convergence_tol</code> do I use in the <a
        href="https://github1s.com/RobotLocomotion/drake/blob/HEAD/bindings/pydrake/systems/test/controllers_test.py"
        target="_vscode">unit test for "fitted value iteration"?</a> </li>
        </ol>

      <p>As you use Drake, if you have any questions, please consider <a
      href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/drake">asking them on
      stack<b>overflow</b></a> using the "drake" tag.  The broader Drake
      developers community will often be able to answer faster (and/or better)
      than the course staff!  And asking there helps to build a searchable
      knowledge base that will make Drake more useful and accessible for
      everyone.</p>

Consider the system: $$y[n] = u[n-3],$$ where $y$ is the output of the system that you're interested in and $u$ is the input which you control, both of which are scalars. In this problem, you'll consider how to choose a state vector $x$ which allows you to model the output trajectory $y$ as $u$ changes.</p>

        <p>Specifically: you will choose a state vector $x$ such that $x[n+1]=Ax[n]+Bu[n]$ and $y[n]=Cx[n],$ where $A$, $B$, and $C$ are all matrices of appropriate size.</p>

        <ol type="a">
            <li>
                <p>What size is (the smallest vector that can be used for) $x[n]$ to represent this system? Explain your answer. (Hint: what happens when you try to simulate the system, either by hand or computationally, with a state that's the wrong size?)</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>For the state size you chose for part (a), what are corresponding $A$, $B$, and $C$ matrices to represent the dynamics of the system?</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                Say we increase the delay between the input and the output to 5: $$y[n] = u[n-5]$$
                Does the size of the state change compared with (a)? Explain why or why not.
            </li>
            <li>
                Consider a system with slightly different dynamics:
                \begin{align*}
                x[n] &= x[n-2] + u[n-1] \\
                y[n] &= x[n] + 1
                \end{align*}
                Given the following library of blocks, draw a block diagram representing the difference equation above.

                </figure>
                For example, the system $y[n] = u[n-1]$ would be represented as follows:
                <figure>
                    <img style="width:30%", src="figures/exercises/block_diagram_example.png"/>
                </figure>
            </li>
        </ol>
