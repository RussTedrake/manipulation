The `System` describes $f()$, but we use a structure called the [`Context`](https://drake.mit.edu/doxygen_cxx/classdrake_1_1systems_1_1_context.html) to hold the runtime values: $n, x, u$.  We use a structure, because some systems have even more runtime values, that describe system parameters, random noise inputs, etc, and it is cleaner to pass a structure around than have each system accept a different list of possible inputs.  As a rule `System` is constant over the duration of a simulation, and you should be able to obtain repeatable, deterministic simulations given any value `Context`.\n",
