<chapter style="counter-reset: chapter 6"><h1>Deep Perception for
Manipulation</h1>

  <p>In the previous chapter, we discussed deep-learning approaches to object
  detection and (instance-level) segmentation; these are general-purpose tasks
  for processing RGB images that are used broadly in computer vision. Detection
  and segmentation alone can be combined with geometric perception to, for
  instance, estimate the pose of a known object in just the segmented point
  cloud instead of the entire scene, or to run our point-cloud grasp selection
  algorithm only on the segmented point cloud in order to pick up an object of
  interest.</p>

  <p>One of the most amazing features of deep learning for perception is that
  we can pre-train on a different dataset (like ImageNet or COCO) or even a
  different task and then fine-tune on our domain-specific dataset or task. But
  what are the right perception tasks for manipulation?  Object detection and
  segmentation are a great start, but often we want to know more about the
  scene/objects to manipulate them. That is the topic of this chapter.</p>

  <p>There is a potential answer to this question that we will defer to a later
  chapter: learning end-to-end "visuomotor" policies, sometimes affectionately
  referred to as "pixels to torques". Here I want us to think first about how
  we can combine a deep-learning-based perception system with the powerful
  existing (model-based) tools that we have been building up for planning and
  control.</p>

  <todo> maybe a system diagram which includes perception, planning and
  control? So far we’ve had two version - grasp candidates and/or object pose…
  </todo>

  <p>I'll start with deep-learning versions of two perception tasks we've
  already considered: object pose estimation and grasp selection.</p>

  <!-- representations of uncertainty should be a theme i'll carry throughout.
  make analogy to object detection outputs (e.g. in mask-rcnn) -->

  <section><h1>Pose estimation</h1>

    <!-- some notes in 2021 lecture 11 ithoughts. -->

    <!-- probably reconstruction loss (for instance, as used by the scoring
    function in BOP) is better than e.g. quaternion loss.  -->

    <!-- NOCS in here? -->

  </section>

  <section><h1>Grasp selection</h1>

  </section>

  <section><h1>(Semantic) Keypoints</h1>
  
    <!-- affordances -->
    <!-- category level -->

    <!-- wei's keypoint labeling tool -->

    <todo>Example: corner keypoints for boxes.  (also pose+shape estimation
    from keypoints?)</todo>
  </section>

  <section><h1>Dense Descriptors</h1>

    <!-- dense correspondence -->
    <!-- anthony's neural descriptor fields -->

  </section>

  <section><h1>Task-level state</h1>

    <!-- tcc.  chris paxton "red block is on the blue block"-->
  
  </section>

  <!-- Can I do a putting it all together section here?? Or in each section? -->

  <section><h1>Other perceptual tasks / representations</h1>
  
    <p>My coverage above is necessarily incomplete and the field is moving
    fast. Here is a quick "shout out" to a few other very relevant ideas.</p>

    <p>More coming soon...</p>
    <!-- shape estimation / completion -->
    <!-- transporter nets -->
    <!-- estimating dynamic parameters (mass / friction / etc) -->

    <!-- danny's compositional nerf? -->
    <!-- probably defer learning dynamics models to another chapter -->
    <!-- M0m from lpk -->
    <!-- Particles? or deformables more generally… -->
    
  </section>

  <!-- maybe add a “looking forward” section?  Cracking an egg, etc.  what
  should the perception system output?  How do we write the planning/control
  system.  This is where full-stack deep learning approaches are winning.  But
  i don’t know that being data-driven (or deep) is fundamental here.

  Maybe future chapter on state representations?  In the model-learning
  section? -->

  <section id="exercises"><h1>Exercises</h1>
    <exercise id="don_contrastive"><h1>Deep Object Net and Contrastive Loss</h1>
      <p>In this problem you will further explore Dense Object Nets, which were introduced in lecture. Dense Object Nets are able to quickly learn consistent pixel-level representations for visual understanding and manipulation. Dense Object Nets are powerful because the representations they predict are applicable to both rigid and non-rigid objects. They can also generalize to new objects in the same class and can be trained with self-supervised learning. For this problem you will work in <script>document.write(notebook_link('contrastive', deepnote['exercises/deep_perception'], link_text='this notebook'))</script> to first implement the loss function used to train Dense Object Nets, and then predict correspondences between images using a trained Dense Object Net.</p>
