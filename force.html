  <h1>Manipulator Control</h1>
    
  <p>Over the last few chapters, we've developed a great initial toolkit for
  perceiving objects (or piles of objects) in a scene, planning grasps, and
  moving the arm to grasp. In the last chapter, we started designing motion
  planning strategies that could produce beautiful smooth joint trajectories
  for the robot that could move it quickly from one grasp to the next. As our
  desired trajectories get closer to the dynamic limits of the robot, then the
  control strategies that we use to execute them on the robot arm also need to
  get a bit more sophisticated.</p>
  
  <p>Remember, too, that there is a lot more to manipulation than grasping!
  Even in the bin picking application, we already have some examples where our
  grasping-only strategy can be insufficient. Imagine that you look through the
  robot cameras into the box and see the following scene:</p>

  <figure><img style="width:60%" src="data/09954.png"/></figure>

  <p>How in the world are we going to pick up that "Cheez-it" cracker box with
  our two-fingered gripper?  (I know there are a few of you out there thinking
  about how easy that scene is for your suction gripper, but suction alone
  isn't going to solve all of our problems either.)</p>

  <figcaption>Just for fun, I asked my daughter to try a similar task with the
  "two-fingered gripper" I scrounged from my kitchen. How are we to program
  something like that!</figcaption></figure>

  <p>The term <i>nonprehensile manipulation</i> means "manipulation without
  grasping", and humans do it often.  It is easy to appreciate this fact when we
  think about pushing an object that is too big to grasp (e.g. an office chair).
  But if you pay close attention, you will see that humans make use of
  strategies like sliding and environmental contact often, even when they are
  grasping. These strategies just come to the forefront in non-grasping
  manipulation.</p>

  <p>As we build up our toolkit for prehensile (grasping) and nonprehensile
  manipulation, one of the things that is missing from our discussion so far,
  which has been predominantly kinematic, has been thinking about forces.  In
  addition to tracking motion planning trajectories, this chapter will also
  introduce control techniques that reason about contact forces. I hope that by
  the end you'll agree that we have pretty satisfying approaches to flipping up
  that box!</p>

  <section id="toolbox"><h1>The Manipulator-Control Toolbox</h1>
  
    <p>When I talk about "manipulator control", I am discussing robot
    controllers that take (slightly) higher-level commands, like desired joint
    positions and velocities or spatial forces, and convert them into motor
    commands. Throughout this chapter we will assume that we can command
    <i>generalized forces</i>, which for revolute-joint robots are just joint
    torques. These controllers, by themselves, are not enough to complete any
    meaningful task -- they are reasoning about the robot itself but not about
    any of the objects in the environment. But they facilitate writing the rest
    of the control systems by providing the higher-level abstraction.</p>
    
    <p>Typically the low-level controllers we will be discussing here are
    implemented in the firmware that runs directly on the robot arm (or its
    control cabinet). For the purposes of using that hardware, it's important
    to understand how they work and how you should set their parameters. In
    simulation we need to implement these controllers ourselves in order to
    model the robot.</p>

    <p>Drake offers a number of <a
    href="https://drake.mit.edu/doxygen_cxx/group__control__systems.html">
    manipulator control implementations</a>. In this chapter, we will work
    through the most relevant ones for controlling a robotic arm:</p>

  </section>

  <section><h1>Assume your robot is a point mass</h1>
  
    <p>As always in our battle against complexity, I want to find a setup that
    is as simple as possible (but no simpler)!  Here is my proposal for the
    box-flipping example.  First, I will restrict all motion to a 2D plane; this
    allows me to chop off two sides of the bin (for you to easily see inside),
    but also drops the number of degrees of freedom we have to consider.  In
    particular, we can avoid the quaternion floating base coordinates, by adding
    a <code>PlanarJoint</code> to the box.  Instead of using a complete gripper,
    let's start even simpler and just use a "point finger".  I've visualized it
    as a small sphere, and modeled two control inputs as providing force
    directly on the $x$ and $z$ coordinates of the point mass.</p>

    <figure><img style="width:60%"
    src="data/point_finger_cracker_box.png"/><figcaption>The simple model: a
    point finger, a cracker box, and the bin all in 2D.  The green arrows are
    the contact forces.</figcaption></figure>

    <p>Even in this simple model, and throughout the discussions in this
    chapter, we will have two dynamic models that we care about.  The first is
    the full dynamic model used for simulation: it contains the finger, the
    box, and the bin, and has a total of 5 degrees of freedom ($x, z, \theta$
    for the box and $x, z$ for the finger).  The second is the robot model used
    for designing the controllers: this model has just the two degrees of
    freedom of the finger, and experiences unmodelled contact forces.  By
    design, the equations of this second model are particularly simple:
    $$\begin{bmatrix}m & 0 \\ 0 & m \end{bmatrix} \dot{v} = m
    \begin{bmatrix}\ddot{x} \\ \ddot{z} \end{bmatrix} = \tau_g +
    \begin{bmatrix} u_x \\ u_z \end{bmatrix} + f^{F_c},$$ where $m$ is the
    mass, $\tau_g$ is the gravitational "torque" which here is just $\tau_g =
    [0, -mg]^T$, $u$ is the control input vector, and $f^{F_c}$ is the
    Cartesian contact force applied to the finger, $F$, at $c$.</p>

    <p>Just to make the notation clear, I've used $f^{F_c}$ above to denote
    force <i>applied to the finger</i>, $F$, at point $c$. If we want to denote
    the same force <i>applied to the box</i>, $B$, at point $c$, then we'll
    denote it as $f^{B_c}$. Naturally, we have $f^{F_c} = - f^{B_c}$, because
    the forces must be equal and opposite. If we're not careful about this
    notation, the signs can get confusing below.</p>

    <subsection><h1>Trajectory tracking</h1>
    
      <p>Before we even make contact with the box, let's make sure we know how
      to move our robot finger around through the air. Assume that you've done
      some motion planning, perhaps using optimization, and have developed a
      beautiful desired trajectory, $q_d(t)$, that you want your finger to
      follow. Let's assume that $q_d(t)$ is twice differentiable. What
      generalized-force commands should you send to the robot to execute that
      trajectory?</p>

      <p>One of the first and most common ways to execute the trajectory is
      with proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control, which we've
      discussed when we talked about <a
      href="robot.html#position-controlled">position-controlled robots</a>. The
      <a
      href="https://drake.mit.edu/doxygen_cxx/classdrake_1_1systems_1_1controllers_1_1_pid_controller.html">PidController</a>
      uses the command $$u(t) = K_p (q_d(t) - q(t)) + K_d (\dot{q}_d(t) -
      \dot{q}(t)) + K_i \int_0^t (q_d(t) - q(t)) dt,$$ with $K_p$, $K_d$, and
      $K_i$ being the position, velocity, and integral gains. Often these gains
      are diagonal matrices, making the command for each joint independent of
      the rest. Note that in manipulation, we tend to avoid the integral term,
      setting $K_i = 0$. You can imagine that if the robot is pushing up
      against the wall and is unable to achieve $q(t) == q_d(t)$, then the
      integral term will "wind-up", sending larger and larger commands to the
      robot until some fault is reached.</p>
      
      <p>PD/PID control can be incredibly effective; it assumes almost nothing
      about the dynamics of the robot. But this assumption is also a
      limitation; if we do know something about the dynamics of the robot than
      we can achieve better tracking performance. To make that clear, let's
      write the closed-loop dynamics under PD control...</p>

      <p>Gravity compensation...  For reasons that will become clear soon, this
      controller is available in Drake as the <a
      href="https://github.com/RobotLocomotion/drake/pull/18272">JointStiffnessController</a>.</p>

      <p>Inverse dynamics control...</p>

      <example><h1>Trajectory tracking for the point mass</h1>

        <p>I've put together an extremely simple example to show the differences in tracking performance for the point mass using each of these control strategies.</p>

        <script>document.write(notebook_link('force', d = deepnote, link_text = "", notebook = "tracking"))</script>

        <todo>insert the figure here</todo>

      </example>

    </subsection>

    <subsection><h1>(Direct) force control</h1>

      <p>In the case of direct force control, we implement a low-level
      controller that accepts the desired contact forces and produces
      generalized force inputs to the robot that try to make the actual contact
      forces match the desired.</p>
      
      <div>
        <script type="text/javascript">
        var force_control = { "name": "ForceControl", 
          "input_ports" : ["estimated_state", "desired_contact_force", '<span style="color:gray">measured_accelerations</span>', '<span style="color:gray">measured_contact_force</span>'],
          "output_ports" : ["generalized_force"]
          };
        document.write(system_html(force_control));
        </script>
      </div>

      <p>What information do we need to regulate the contact forces?  Certainly
      we need the desired contact force, $f^{F_c}_{desired}$.  In general, we
      will need the robot's state (though in the immediate example, the
      dynamics of our point mass are not state dependent).  But we also need to
      either (1) measure the robot accelerations (which we've repeatedly tried
      to avoid), (2) assume the robot accelerations are zero, or (3) provide a
      measurement of the contact force so that we can regulate it with
      feedback.</p>
      
      <p>Let's consider the case where the robot is already in contact with the
      box.  Let's also assume for a moment that the accelerations are (nearly)
      zero.  This is actually not a horrible assumption for most manipulation
      tasks, where the movements are relatively slow.  In this case, our
      equations of motion reduce to $$f^{F_c} = - mg - u.$$  Our force
      controller implementation can be as simple as $u = -mg -
      f^{F_c}_{desired}.$  Note that we only need to know the mass <i>of the
      robot</i> (not the box) to implement this controller.</p>

      <p>What happens when the robot is not in contact?  In this case, we
      cannot reasonably ignore the accelerations, and applying the same control
      results in $m\dot{v} = - f^{F_c}_{desired}.$  That's not all bad.  In
      fact, it's one of the defining features of force control that makes it
      very appealing.  When you specify a desired force and don't get it, the
      result is accelerating the contact point in the (opposite) direction of
      the desired force.  In practice, this (locally) tends to bring you into
      contact when you are not in contact.</p>

      <example><h1>Commanding a constant force</h1>

        <p>Let's see what happens when we run a full simulation which includes
        not only the non-contact case and the contact case, but also the
        transition between the two (which involves collision dynamics).  I'll
        start the point finger next to the box, and apply a constant force
        command requesting to get a horizontal contact force from the box.  I've
        drawn the $x$ trajectory of the finger for different (constant) contact
        force commands.</p>

        <figure><img style="margin-top:-20px; width:70%"
        src="data/constant_force_box.svg"><figcaption>This is a plot of the
        horizontal position of the finger as a function of time, given different
        constant desired force commands.</figcaption></figure>
        
        <p>For all strictly positive desired force commands, the finger will
        accelerate at a constant rate until it collides with the box (at
        $x=0.089$).  For small $f^{F_c}_{desired}$, the box barely moves.  For
        an intermediate range of $f^{F_c}_{desired}$, the collision with the
        box is enough to start it moving, but friction eventually brings the
        box and therefore also the finger to rest.  For large values, the
        finger will keep pushing the box until it runs into the far wall.</p>

        <script>document.write(notebook_link('force', d = deepnote, link_text = "", notebook = "point_finger"))</script>
          
      </example>

      <p>Consider the consequences of this behavior.  By commanding force, we
      can write a controller that will come into a nice contact with the box
      with essentially no information about the geometry of the box (we just
      need enough perception to start our finger in a location for which a
      straight-line approach will reach the box).</p>

      <p>This is one of the reasons that researchers working on legged robots
      also like force control.  On a force-capable walking robot, we might mimic
      position control during the "swing phase", to get our foot approximately
      where we are hoping to step.  But then we switch to a force control mode
      to actually set the foot down on the ground.  This can significantly
      reduce the requirements for accurate sensing of the terrain.</p>

      <example id="force_flip_up"><h1>A force-based flip-up strategy</h1>
      
        <todo>Update the code to match this updated derivation. In particular,
        \theta_d(t) should get more negative.</todo>

        <p>Here is my proposal for a simple strategy for flipping up the box.
        Once in contact, we will use the contact force from the finger to apply
        a moment around the bottom left corner of the box to generate the
        rotation. But we'll add constraints to the forces that we apply so that
        the bottom corner does not slip. </p>
    
        <figure><img style="margin-top:-20px; width:60%"
        src="data/force_flip_up.png"><figcaption>Flipping the box.  <a
        href="data/force_flip_up.html">Click here</a> for an animation of the
        controller we'll write in the example below.  But it's worth running
        the code, where you can see the contact force visualization,
        too!</figcaption></figure>
  
        <p>These conditions are very natural to express in terms of forces.
        And once again, we can implement this strategy with very little
        information about the box.  The position of the finger will evolve
        naturally as we apply the contact forces.  It's harder for me to
        imagine how to write an equally robust strategy using a (high-gain)
        position-controller finger; it would likely require many more
        assumptions about the geometry (and possibly the mass) of the box.</p>

        <p>Let's encode the textual description above, describing the forces
        that are applied to the box. I'll use $C$ for the contact frame
        between the finger and the box, with its normal pointing <i>into</i>
        the box normal to the surface, and $A$ for the contact frame for the
        lower left corner of the box contacting the bin, with the normal
        pointing straight up in positive world $z$. $${}^BR^C =
        R_y(-\frac{\pi}{2}), \qquad {}^WR^A = I,$$ where $R_y(\theta)$ is a
        rotation by $\theta$ around the y axis. Of course we also have the
        force of gravity, which is applied at the body center of mass (com):
        $$f^{B_{com}}_{gravity,W} = mg.$$ As you can see, we'll make heavy use
        of the spatial force notation / spatial algebra <a
        href="clutter.html#spatial_force">described here</a>.</p>
        
        <p>The friction cone provides (linear inequality) constraints on the
        forces we want to apply. \begin{gather*} f^{B_C}_{\text{finger}, C_z}
        \ge 0, \qquad |f^{B_C}_{\text{finger}, C_x}| \le \hat\mu_C
        f^{B_C}_{\text{finger}, C_z}, \\ f^{B_A}_{\text{ground}, A_z} \ge 0,
        \qquad |f^{B_A}_{\text{ground}, A_x}| \le \hat\mu_A
        f^{B_A}_{\text{ground}, A_z}.\end{gather*} Please make sure you
        understand the notation.  Within those constraints, we would like to
        rotate up the box.</p>
        
        <p>To rotate the box about $A$, let's reason about the total torque
        being applied about $A$: $$\tau^{B_A}_{total,W} = \tau^{B_A}_{gravity,
        W} + \tau^{B_A}_{ground, W} + \tau^{B_A}_{finger, W},$$ but we know
        that $\tau^{B_A}_{ground, W} = 0$ since the moment arm is zero. I have
        a goal here of not making too many assumptions about the mass and
        geometry of the box in our controller, so rather than try to regulate
        this torque perfectly, let's write $$\tau^{B_A}_{total,W_y} =
        \tau^{B_A}_{finger,W_y} + \text{unknown terms}.$$ <!--
        and if we choose to
        assume that the box is longer than it is tall (so ${}^Ap^C_{B_x} \gg
        {}^Ap^C_{B_z}$), we can have approximately $$\tau^{B_A}_{finger,W_y}
        \approx {}^A\hat{p}^C_{B_x} \, f^{B_C}_{finger, C_x}.$$ -->
        A reasonable control strategy in the face of these unmodeled terms is
        to use feedback control on the angle of the box (call it $\theta$)
        which is the $y$ component of ${}^WR^B$: $$ \tau^{B_A}_{finger_d,W_y} =
        \text{PID}(\theta_d, \theta), \qquad {}^WR^B(\theta) = R_y(\theta),$$
        where I've used $\theta_{d}$ as shorthand for the desired box angle and
        $\text{PID}$ as shorthand for a simple proportional-integral-derivative
        term. Note that $\tau^{B_A}_{finger,W_y} \propto f^{B_C}_{finger,
        C_x},$ where the (constant) coefficient only depends on
        ${}^B\hat{p}^C;$ it does not actually depend on $\hat\theta.$</p>
        
        <p>To execute the desired PID control subject to the friction-cone
        constraints, we can use constrained least-squares:
        \begin{align*}\min_{f^{B_C}_{finger,C}, \, f^{B_A}_{ground,A}} \quad&
        \left| \tau^{B_A}_{finger,W_y} - \text{PID}(\theta_d, \hat\theta)
        \right|^2,\\ \subjto \quad & f^{B_C}_{\text{finger}, C_z} \ge 0, \qquad
        |f^{B_C}_{\text{finger}, C_x}| \le \hat\mu_C f^{B_C}_{\text{finger},
        C_z}, \\ & f^{B_A}_{\text{ground}, A_z} \ge 0, \qquad
        |f^{B_A}_{\text{ground}, A_x}| \le \hat\mu_A f^{B_A}_{\text{ground},
        A_z}, \\ & f^{B_A}_{\text{ground}, A} + \hat{f}^{B_A}_{gravity, A} +
        f^{B_A}_{finger, A} = 0.\end{align*} Note that the last line is still a
        linear constraint once $\hat\theta$ is given, despite requiring some
        spatial algebra operations. Implementing this strategy assumes:
        <ul style="margin-top:-10px; margin-bottom:5px"><li>We have some
        approximation, $\hat\theta$, for the orientation of the box.  We could
        obtain this from a point cloud normal estimation, or even from tracking
        the path of the fingers.</li>
        <li>We have conservative estimates of the coefficients of static
        friction between the wall and the box, $\hat\mu_A$, and between the
        finger and the box, $\hat\mu_C$, as well as the approximate location of
        the finger relative to the box corner, and the box mass,
        $\hat{m}.$</li>
        </ul> You should experiment and decide for yourself whether these
        estimates can be loose. I think that you'll find it's quite robust to
        knowing the mass and geometry of the box.</p>

        <p>We have multiple controllers in this example.  The first is the
        low-level force controller that takes a desired contact force and sends
        commands to the robot to attempt to regulate this force.  The second is
        the higher-level controller that is looking at the orientation of the
        box and deciding which forces to request from the low-level
        controller.</p>
    
        <p>Please also understand that this is not some unique or optimal strategy
        for box flipping.  I'm simply trying to demonstrate that sometimes

    <subsection><h1>Indirect force control</h1>

      <p>There is a nice philosophical alternative to controlling the contact
      interactions by specifying the forces directly.  Instead, we can program
      our robot to act like a (simple) mechanical system that reacts to contact
      forces in a desired way.  This philosophy was described nicely in an
      important series of papers by Ken Salisbury introducing <i>stiffness
      control</i> <elib>Salisbury80</elib> and then Neville Hogan introducing
      <i>impedance control</i> <elib>Hogan85a+Hogan85b+Hogan85c</elib>.</p>

      <p>This approach is conceptually very nice. Imagine we were to walk up
      and push on the end-effector of the iiwa. With only knowledge of the
      parameters of the robot itself (not the environment), we can write a
      controller so that when we push on the end-effector, the end-effector
      pushes back (using the entire robot) as if you were pushing on, for
      instance, a simple spring-mass-damper system.  Rather than attempting to
      achieve manipulation by moving the end-effector rigidly through a series
      of position commands, we can move the set points (and perhaps stiffness)
      of a soft virtual spring, and allow this virtual spring to generate our
      desired contact forces.</p>
      
      <p>This approach can also have nice advantages for guaranteeing that your
      robot won't go unstable even in the face of unmodeled contact
      interactions.  If the robot acts like a dissipative system and the
      environment is a dissipative system, then the entire system will be
      stable.  Arguments of this form can ensure stability for even very complex
      system, building on the rich literature on <i>passivity theory</i> or more
      generally <i>Port-Hamiltonian</i>
      systems<elib>Duindam09</elib>.</p>

      <p>Our simple model with a point finger is ideal for understanding the
      essence of indirect force control.  The original equations of motion of
      our system are $$m\begin{bmatrix}\ddot{x} \\ \ddot{z} \end{bmatrix} = mg
      + u + f^{F_c}.$$  We can write a simple controller to make this system
      act, instead, like (passive) mass-spring-damper system: $$m
      \begin{bmatrix}\ddot{x} \\ \ddot{z} \end{bmatrix} + b \begin{bmatrix}
      \dot{x} \\ \dot{z} \end{bmatrix} + k \begin{bmatrix} x - x_d \\ z - z_d
      \end{bmatrix} = f^{F_c},$$ with the rest position of the spring at $(x_d,
      z_d).$  The controller that implements this follows easily; in the point
      finger case this has the familiar form of a proportional-derivative (PD)
      controller, but with an additional "feed-forward" term to cancel out
      gravity.</p>

      <p>Technically, if we are just programming the stiffness and damping, as
      I've written here, then a controller of this form would commonly be
      referred to as "stiffness control", which is a subset of impedance
      control.  We could also change the effective mass of the system; this
      would be impedance control in its full glory. <!--Importantly, changing
      the effective mass can be done without estimating the accelerations, but
      it does require measuring the contact force.-->  My impression, though,
      is that the consensus in robot control experts is that changing the
      effective mass is most often considered not worth the complexity that
      comes from the extra sensing and bandwidth requirements.</p>

      <p>The literature on indirect force control has a lot of terminology and
      implementation details that are important to get right in practice.  Your
      exact implementation will depend on, for instance, whether you have access
      to a force sensor and whether you can command forces/torque directly.  The
      performance can vary significantly based on the bandwidth of your
      controller and the quality of your sensors.  See e.g.
      <elib>Villani08</elib> for a more thorough survey (and also some fun older
      videos), or <elib>Whitney87</elib> for a nice earlier perspective.</p>

      <!--
      <p>We can also program the response if we have a position-controlled robot with a force-torque sensor.  This is called <i>admittance control</i>.  In its simplest form, we can say that the original equations of motion already contain a PD controller, and our only command input is to modulate the setpoints of that controller.  For a single degree of freedom, we have $$m\ddot{q} + \text{unmodelled terms} = k_p(q_d - q) + k_d(\dot{q}_d - \dot{q}) + f^c.$$ </p>
      -->

      <example><h1>Teleop with stiffness control</h1>
        
        <p>I didn't give you a teleop interface with direct force control; it
        would have been very difficult to use!  Moving the robot by positioning
        the set points on virtual springs, however, is quite natural. Take a
        minute to try moving the box around, or even flipping it up.</p>

        <script>document.write(notebook_link('force', d = deepnote, link_text = "", notebook = "point_finger"))</script>
    
        <p>To help your intuition, I've made the bin and the box slightly
        transparent, and added a visualization (in orange) of the virtual finger
        or gripper that you are moving with the sliders.</p>

      </example>

      <p>Let's embrace indirect force control to come up with another approach
      to flipping up the box.  Flipping the box up in the middle of the bin
      required very explicit reasoning about forces in order to stay inside the
      friction cone in the bottom left corner of the box.  But there is another
      strategy that doesn't require as precise control of the forces.  Let's
      push the box into the corner, and <i>then</i> flip it up.</p>

      <figure><img style="width:70%" src="data/impedance-based-flip-up.jpeg"></figure>
    
      <p>To make this one happen, I'd like to imagine creating a virtual spring
      -- you can think of it like a taut rubber band -- that we attach from
      the finger to a point near the wall just a little above the top left
      corner of the box.  The box will act like a pendulum, rotating around the
      top corner, with the rubber band creating the moment.  At some point the
      top corner will slip, but the very same rubber band will have the finger
      pushing the box down from the top corner to complete the maneuver.</p>

      <p>Consider the alternative of writing an estimator and controller that
      needed to detect the moment of slip and make a new plan.  That is not a
      road to happiness.  By only using our model of the robot to make the robot
      act like a different dynamical system at the point we can accomplish all
      of that!</p>

      <example><h1>A stiffness-control-based flip-up strategy</h1>

        <p>This controller almost couldn't be simpler.  I will just command a
        trajectory the move the virtual finger to just in front of the wall.
        This will push the box into contact and establish our bracing contact
        force.  Then I'll move the virtual finger (the other end of our rubber
        band) up the wall a bit, and we can let mechanics take care of the
        rest!</p>

        <script>document.write(notebook_link('force', d = deepnote, link_text = "", notebook = "point_finger"))</script>
    
      </example>

      <p>So far we've made our finger act like two independent
      mass-spring-damper systems, one in $x$ and the other in $z$. We even used
      the same stiffness, $k$, and damping, $b$, parameters for each.  More
      generally, we can write stiffness and damping matrices, which we
      typically would call $K_p$ and $K_d$, respectively: $$m
      \begin{bmatrix}\ddot{x} \\ \ddot{z} \end{bmatrix} + K_d \begin{bmatrix}
      \dot{x} \\ \dot{z} \end{bmatrix} + K_p \begin{bmatrix} x - x_d \\ z - z_d
      \end{bmatrix} = f^{F_c}.$$  In order to emphasize the coordinate frame of
      these stiffness matrices, let's write exactly the same equation,
      realizing that with our point finger we have ${}^Wp^F = \begin{bmatrix}
      x, z\end{bmatrix}^T,$ so: $$m\,{}^W\dot{v}^F + K_d \, {}^Wv^F +
      K_p\left({}^Wp^F - {}^Wp^{F_d}\right) = f^F.$$  Sometimes it can be
      convenient to express the stiffness (and/or damping) matrices in a
      different frame, $A$: \begin{align*} m\,{}^W\dot{v}^F + {}^W R^A K_d \,
      {}^Wv^F_A + {}^WR^W K_p\left({}^Wp^F_A - {}^Wp^{F_d}_A\right) =& \\
      m\,{}^W\dot{v}^F + {}^W R^A K_d {}^A R^W\, {}^Wv^F + {}^WR^A K_p {}^A
      R^W\left(\,{}^Wp^F - {}^Wp^{F_d}\right) =& \, f^F.\end{align*}</p>

    </subsection>

    <subsection><h1>Hybrid position/force control</h1>

      <p>There are a number of applications where we would like to explicitly
      command force in one direction, but command positions in another.  One
      classic examples if you are trying to wipe or polish a surface -- you
      might care about the amount of force you are applying normal to the
      surface, but use position feedback to follow a trajectory in the
      directions tangent to the surface.  In the simplest case, imagine
      controlling force in $z$ and position in $x$ for our point finger: $$u =
      -mg + \begin{bmatrix} k_p (x_d - x) + k_d (\dot{x}_d - \dot{x}) \\
      -f^F_{desired, W_z} \end{bmatrix}.$$  If want the forces/positions in a
      different frame, for instance the contact frame, $C$, then we can use
      \begin{equation} u = -mg + {}^WR^C \begin{bmatrix} k_p (p^{F_d}_{C_x} -
      p^{F}_{C_x}) + k_d (v^{F_d}_{C_x} - v^F_{C_x}) \\ -f^{F}_{desired,
      C_z}\end{bmatrix}. \label{eq:position-or-force}\end{equation}  By commanding the normal force, you not
      only have the benefit of controlling how hard the robot is pushing on the
      surface, but also gain some robustness to errors in estimating the
      surface normal.  If a position-controlled robot estimated the normal of a
      wall badly, then it might leave the wall entirely in one direction, and
      push extremely hard in the other.  Having a commanded force in the normal
      direction would allow the position of the robot in that direction to
      become whatever is necessary to apply the force, and it will follow the
      wall.</p>

        <figcaption>A simple example of hybrid position/force control; the
        robot needs to push down hard enough that the contact between the
        fingers and book do not slip, but gentle enough that the contacts
        between the book at the table <i>do</i> slide. This is naturally
        accomplished with force control in the world $z$. But moving the
        gripper/book in the $x,y$ plane is more naturally described using
        position control. You can explore this example in more detail in <a
        href="#hybrid_book_push">an exercise</a>.</figcaption>

      <todo>Check yourself: can the finger move the box?  (only if the coefficient of friction is bigger).</todo>      

      <p>The choice of position control or force control need not be a binary
      decision.  We can simply apply both the position command (as in
      stiffness/impedance control) and a "feed-forward" force command: $$u =
      -mg + K_p (p^{F_d} - p^{F}) + K_d (v^{F_d} - v^{F}) -
      f^{F}_{\text{feedforward}}.$$ Certainly this is only more general that
      the explicit position-or-force mode in Eq. (\ref{eq:position-or-force});
      we could achieve the explicit position-or-force in this interface by the
      appropriate choices of $K_p$, $K_d$, and $f^F_{feedforward}.$ As we'll
      see, this is quite similar to the interface provided by the iiwa (and
      many other torque-controlled robots).</p>

  <section><h1>The general case (using the manipulator equations)</h1>

    <p>Using the floating finger/gripper is a good way to understand the main
    concepts of force control without the details.  But now it's time to
    actually implement those strategies using joint commands that we can send to
    the arm.</p>

    <p>Our starting point is understanding that the equations of motion for a
    fully-actuated robotic manipulator have a very structured form:
    \begin{equation}M(q)\ddot{q} + C(q,\dot{q})\dot{q} = \tau_g(q) + u + \sum_i
    J^T_i(q)f^{c_i}.\label{eq:manipulator} \end{equation}  The left side of the
    equation is just a generalization of "mass times acceleration", with the
    mass matrix, $M$, and the Coriolis terms $C$.  The right hand side is the
    sum of the (generalized) forces, with $\tau_g(q)$ capturing the forces due
    to gravity, $u$ the joint torques supplied by the motors, and $f^{c_i}$ is
    the Cartesian force due to the $i$th contact, where $J_i(q)$ is the $i$th
    "contact Jacobian".  I introduced a version of these briefly when we
    described multibody dynamics for dropping random objects into the bin, and
    have more notes <a
    href="http://underactuated.mit.edu/multibody.html">available here</a>.  For
    the purposes of the remainder of this chapter, we can assume that the robot
    is bolted to the table, so does not have any floating joints; I've therefore
    used $\dot{q}$ and $\ddot{q}$ instead of $v$ and $\dot{v}$.</p>

    <subsection><h1>Trajectory tracking</h1>

<!--
      <p>There is a variation on the joint-space stiffness control that we use
      often in simulation; we call it <a
      href="https://drake.mit.edu/doxygen_cxx/classdrake_1_1systems_1_1controllers_1_1_inverse_dynamics_controller.html">InverseDynamicsControl</a>.  </p>
-->
      <p>Let us ignore the contact terms for a moment: $$M(q)\ddot{q} +
      C(q,\dot{q})\dot{q} = \tau_g(q) + u.$$  The <i>forward dynamics</i>
      problem, which we use during simulation, is to compute the
      accelerations, $\ddot{q}$, given the joint torques, $u$, (and $q,
      \dot{q}$).  The <i>inverse dynamics</i>
      problem, which we can use in control, is to compute $u$ given $\ddot{q}$
      (and $q, \dot{q}$).  As a system, it looks like</p>

      <div>
        <script type="text/javascript">
        var inverse_dynamics = { "name": "InverseDynamics", 
          "input_ports" : ["estimated_state", "desired_acceleration"],
          "output_ports" : ["actuation_input"]
          };
        document.write(system_html(inverse_dynamics, "https://drake.mit.edu/doxygen_cxx/classdrake_1_1systems_1_1controllers_1_1_inverse_dynamics.html"));
        </script>
      </div>

      <p>This system implements the controller: $$u = M(q)\ddot{q}_d +
      C(q,\dot{q})\dot{q} - \tau_g(q),$$ so that the resulting dynamics are
      $M(q)\ddot{q} = M(q)\ddot{q}_d.$  Since we know that $M(q)$ is invertible,
      this implies that $\ddot{q} = \ddot{q}_d$.</p>

      <p>When we put the contact forces back in, In practice, we only have
      estimates of the dynamics (mass matrix, etc) and even the states $q$ and
      $\dot{q}$.  We will need to account for these errors when we determine
      the acceleration commands to send.  For example, if we wanted to follow a
      desired joint trajectory, $q_0(t)$, we do not just differentiate the
      trajectory twice and command $\ddot{q}_0(t)$, but we could instead
      command e.g. $$\ddot{q}_d = \ddot{q}_0(t) + K_p(q_0(t) - q) +
      K_d(\dot{q}_0(t) - \dot{q}).$$  One could also include an integral gain
      term.</p>

      <p>The resulting <code>System</code> has one additional input port for the desired state:</p>

        </script>
      </div>
      <p>This "inverse dynamics control" also appears in the literature with a
      few other names, such as "computed-torque control" and even the
      "feedforward-plus-feedback-linearizing control" <elib
      part="11.4.1.3">Lynch17</elib>.</p>

      <details style-type="box"><summary><b>Check yourself:</b> What is the
      difference between the joint stiffness control and the inverse dynamics
      control?</summary> <p>The closed-loop dynamics with the joint stiffness
      control (taking $\tau_{ff} = 0$) are given by $$M(q)\ddot{q} +
      C(q,\dot{q})\dot{q} + K_p(q - q_d) + K_d(\dot{q} - \dot{q}_d) =
      \tau_{ext},$$ where $\tau_{ext}$ summarized the results of (unmodeled)
      forces like contacts. The closed-loop dynamics with the inverse dynamics
      controllers are given by $$\ddot{q} + K_p(q - q_d) + K_d(\dot{q} -
      \dot{q}_d) = M^{-1}(q) \tau_{ext}.$$  So the inverse dynamics controller
      writes the feedback law in the units of accelerations rather than forces;
      this would be similar to shaping the internal matrix into the diagonal
      matrix.</p>  
      
      <p>The ability to realize this cancellation in hardware, however, will be
      limited by the accuracy with which we estimate the model parameters,
      $\hat{M}(q)$ and $\hat{C}(q,\dot{q})$.  The stiffness controller, on the
      other hand, achieves much of the desired performance but only attempts to
      cancel the gravity (and perhaps friction) terms; it does not shape the
      inertia.</p></details>

    <subsection><h1>Direct force control</h1>

      <p>Let's bring back our contact forces, but assume that we are only making
      contact at a single, known, point on the robot: $$M(q)\ddot{q} +
      C(q,\dot{q})\dot{q} = \tau_g(q) + u + J^T(q)f^c.$$  <!--Very often in
      manipulation we assume that our dynamics are <i>quasi-static</i>: that the

      on them can be safely ignored.  In a quasi-static analysis, we have the force-balance equations $$\tau_g(q) + u = - J^T(q) F^c.$$  As a result, we can command the desired force by compensating for gravity and any other known forces</p> --> <!--

    <subsection><h1>Joint stiffness control</h1>

      <p>In practice, the way that we most often interface with the iiwa is
      through the its "joint-impedance control" mode, which is written up
      nicely in <elib>Ott08+Albu-Schaffer07</elib>.  For our purposes, we can
      view this as a stiffness control in joint space: $$u = -\tau_g(q) +
      K_p(q_d - q) + K_d(\dot{q}_d - \dot{q}) + \tau_{ff},$$ where $K_p, K_d$
      are positive diagonal matrices, and $\tau_{ff}$ is a "feed-forward"
      torque.  In practice the controller also includes some joint friction
      compensation<elib>Albu-Schaffer01</elib>, but I've left those friction
      terms out here for the sake of brevity.  The controller does also do some
      shaping of the inertias (earning it the label "impedance control" instead
      of only "stiffness control"), but only the rotor inertias, and the user
      does not set these effective inertias.  From the user perspective it
      should be viewed as stiffness control.</p>

      <details style-type="box"><summary><b>Check yourself:</b> What is the
      difference between traditional position control with a PD controller and

      quite small.  A PD control would typically have the form $$u=K_p(q_d-q) +
      K_d(\dot{q}_d - \dot{q}),$$ whereas stiffness control is $$u = -\tau_g(q)
      + K_p(q_d-q) + K_d(\dot{q}_d - \dot{q}).$$  In other words, stiffness
      control tries to cancel out the gravity and any other estimated terms,
      like friction, in the model.  As written, this obviously requires an
      estimated model (which we have for iiwa, but don't believe we have for
      most arms with large gear-ratio transmissions) and torque control.  But
      this small difference in the algebra can make a profound difference in
      practice. The controller is no longer depending on error to achieve the
      joint position in steady state. As such we can turn the gains way down,
      and in practice have a much more compliant response while still achieving
      good tracking when there are no external torques.</p></details>

    <subsection><h1>Cartesian stiffness control</h1>

      <p>A better analogy for the control we were doing with the point finger
      example is to write a controller so that the robot acts like a simple
      dynamical system in the world frame.  To do that, we have to identify a
      frame, $E$ for "end-effector", on the robot where we want to impose these
      simple dynamics -- ideally the origin of this frame will be the expected
      point of contact with the environment. Following our treatment of <a
      href="pick.html#kinematics">kinematics</a>
      and <a href="pick.html#jacobian">differential kinematics</a>, we'll
      define the forward kinematics of this frame as: \begin{equation}p^E =
      f_{kin}(q), \qquad v^E = \dot{p}^E = J(q) \dot{q}, \qquad a^E =
      \ddot{p}^E = J(q)\ddot{q} + \dot{J}(q)
      \dot{q}.\label{eq:kinematics}\end{equation} We haven't actually written
      the second derivative before, but it follows naturally from the chain
      rule. Also, I've restricted this to the Cartesian positions for
      simplicity; one can think about the orientation of the end-effector, but
      this requires some care in defining the 3D stiffness in orientation (e.g.
      <elib>Suh22</elib>).</p>

      <p>One of the big ideas from manipulator control is that we can actually
      write the dynamics of the robot in the frame $E$, by parameterizing the
      joint torques as a translational force applied to body $B$ at $E$,
      $f^{B_E}_u$: $u = J^T(q) f^{B_E}_u$. This comes from the <a
      href="https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mechanical-engineering/2-12-introduction-to-robotics-fall-2005/lecture-notes/chapter6.pdf">principle
      of virtual work</a>.  By substituting this and the manipulator equations
      (\ref{eq:manipulator}) into (\ref{eq:kinematics}) and assuming that the
      only external contacts happen at $E$, we can write the dynamics:
      \begin{equation} M_E(q) \ddot{p}^E + C_E(q,\dot{q})\dot{q} = f^{B_E}_g(q)
      + f^{B_E}_u + f^{B_E}_{ext} \label{eq:cartesian_dynamics},\end{equation}
      where $$M_E(q) = (J M^{-1} J^T)^{-1}, \qquad C_E(q,\dot{q}) = M_E \left(J
      M^{-1} C+ \dot{J} \right), \qquad f^{B_E}_g(q) = M_E J M^{-1} \tau_g.$$
      Now if we simply apply a controller analogous to what we used in joint
      space, e.g.: $$f^{B_E}_u = -f^{B_E}_g(q) + K_p(p^{E_d} - p^E) +
      K_d(\dot{p}^{E_d} - \dot{p}^E),$$ then we can achieve the desired
      closed-loop dynamics <i>at the end-effector</i>: $$M_E(q) \ddot{p}^E +
      C_E(q,\dot{q})\dot{q} + K_p(p^{E} - p^{E_d}) + K_d(\dot{p}^{E} -
      \dot{p}^{E_d}) = f^{B_E}_{ext}.$$ So if I push on the robot at the
      end-effector, the entire robot will move in a way that will make it feel
      like I'm pushing on a spring-damper system. Beautiful!</p>
      
      <p>When $J(q)$ can be rank-deficient (for instance, if you have more
      degrees of freedom than you are trying to control at the end-effector),
      you'll also want to add some terms to similar to 
      <a href="pick.html#joint_centering">stabilize the null space of your
      Jacobian</a>. Since we are operating here with torques instead of
      velocity commands, the natural analogue is to write the a joint-centering
      PD controller that operates in the nullspace of the end-effector control:
      $$u = J^Tf^{B_E}_u + [I - J^+J][K_{p,joint} (q_0 - q) -
      K_{d,joint}\dot{q}].$$</p>
      
      <p>This approach of programming the task-space dynamics with
      secondary joint-space objectives operating in the nullspace was developed
      in <elib>Khatib87</elib> and is known as <i>operational space control</i>. It can be generalized to a rich composition of
      <i>prioritized</i> task-space and joint-space control objectives; the
      prioritization is accomplished by putting lower-priority tasks in the
      nullspace of the primary task. Like the joint-centering differential
      inverse kinematics, these can also be understood through the lens of
      least-squares optimization.</p>

    </subsection>

    <subsection><h1>Some implementation details on the iiwa</h1>

      <p>The implementation of the low-level impedance controllers has many
      details that are explained nicely in <elib>Ott08+Albu-Schaffer07</elib>.
      In particular, the authors go to quite some length to implement the
      impedance law in the actuator coordinates rather than the joint
      coordinates (remember that they have an elastic transmission in between
      the two).  I suspect there are many subtle reasons to prefer this, but
      they go to lengths to demonstrate that they can make a true passivity
      argument with this controller.</p>

      <p>The iiwa interface offers a Cartesian impedance control mode.  If we
      want high performance stiffness control in end-effector coordinates, then
      we should definitely use it! The iiwa controller runs at a much higher
      bandwidth (faster update rate) than the interface we have over the
      provided network API, and many implementation details that they have gone
      to great lengths to get right. But in practice we do not use it, because
      we cannot convert between joint impedance control and Cartesian impedance
      control without shutting down the robot.  Sigh.  In fact we cannot even
      change the stiffness gains nor the frame $C$ (aka the "end-effector
      location") without stopping the robot.  So we stay in joint impedance mode
      and command some Cartesian forces through $\tau_{ff}$ if we desire them.
      (If you are interested in the driver details, then I would recommend the
      documentation for the
      <a href="https://frankaemika.github.io/docs/libfranka.html">Franka Control
      Interface</a> which is much easier to find and read, and is very similar
      to functionality provided by the iiwa driver.)</p>
  
      <p>You might also notice that the interface we provide to the
      <code>IiwaDriver</code> in the <code>HardwareStation</code> takes a
      desired joint position for the robot, but not a desired joint velocity.
      That is because we cannot actually send a desired joint velocity to the
      iiwa controller.  In practice, we believe that they are numerically
      differentiating our position commands to obtain the desired velocity,
      which adds a delay of a few control timesteps (and sometimes <a
      href="https://github.com/RobotLocomotion/drake/issues/11955#issuecomment-524467883">non-monotonic
      behavior</a>).  I believe that the reason why we aren't allowed to send
      our own joint velocity commands is to to make the passivity argument in
      their paper go through, and perhaps to make a simpler/safer API -- they
      don't want users to be able to send a series of inconsistent position and
      velocity commands (where the velocities are not actually the time
      derivatives of the positions).</p>

      <todo>Summarize the email exchange with the kuka folks describing these
      details.</todo>

      <p>Since the controller attempts to cancel gravitational terms, one can
      also tell the iiwa firmware about the lumped inertia of the gripper. This
      is set just once (in the pendant), and cannot be changed while the robot
      is moving; if you pick something up (or even move the fingers), those
      changes in the gravitational terms will not be compensated in the
      controller.</p>

      <p>Although the JointStiffnessController in Drake is the best model for
      the iiwa control stack, we commonly use the InverseDynamicsController in
      our simulations instead. This is for a fairly subtle reason -- the
      numerics are better. The effective stiffness of the differential
      equations to achieve comparable stiffness in the physics is smaller, and
      one can take bigger integration timesteps. On the iiwa hardware, we
      commonly use [800., 600, 600, 600, 400, 200, 200] Nm/rad as the stiffness
      values for the JointStiffnessController; but simulating with those
      requires small integration steps.</p>

  <section><h1>Peg in hole</h1>

    <p>One of the classic problems for manipulator force control, inspired by
    robotic assembly, is the problem of mating two parts together under
    tight kinematic tolerances.  Perhaps the cleanest and most famous version of
    this is the problem of inserting a (round) peg into a (round) hole.  If your
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_peg_in_a_round_hole">peg is
    square and your hole is round</a>, I can't help.  Interestingly, much of the
    literature on this topic in the late 1970's and early 1980's came out of MIT
    and the Draper Laboratory.</p>

    <figure><img width="35%" src="data/peg-in-hole.png"> <img style="margin-left:4%; margin-right:10%;" width="18%" src="data/peg-in-hole-force.png"> <img width="16%" src="data/peg-in-hole-moment.png"><figcaption>(Left) the
    "peg in hole" insertion problem with kinematic tolerance $c$.  (Middle) the
    desired response to a contact force.  (Right) the desired response to a
    contact moment.  Figures reproduced (with some symbols removed) from
    <elib>Drake78</elib>.
    </figcaption></figure>

    <p>For many peg insertion tasks, it's acceptable to add a small <a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chamfer_(geometry)">chamfer</a> to the
    part and/or the top of the hole.  This allows small errors in horizontal
    alignment to be accounted for with a simple compliance in the horizontal
    direction.  Misalignment in orientation is even more interesting.  Small
    misalignments can cause the object to become "jammed", at which point the
    frictional forces become large and ambiguous (under the Coulomb model); we
    really want to avoid this. Again, we can avoid jamming by allowing a
    rotational compliance at the contact.  I think you can see why this is a
    great example for force control!</p>

    <p>The key insight here is that the rotational stiffness that we want
    should result in rotations around the part/contact, not around the gripper.
    We can program this with stiffness control; but for very tight tolerances
    the sensing and bandwidth requirements become a real limitation.  One of
    the coolest results in force control is the realization that a clever
    physical mechanism can be used to produce a "remote-centered compliance"
    (RCC) completely mechanically, with infinite bandwidth and no sensing
    required <elib>Drake78</elib>!</p>

    <p>Interestingly, the peg-in-hole problem inspired incredibly important
    and influential ideas in mechanics and control, but also in motion planning
    <elib>Lozano-Perez84</elib>.  The general ideas are quite relevant and applicable for a wide variety of tasks for which compliant contact is a reasonable strategy, such as opening doors, tool use, etc.</p>

  <section><h1>Exercises</h1>

    <exercise><h1>Force and Position Control</h1>

      <p> Suppose you are given a point-mass system with the following dynamics:</p>
      $$m\ddot{x} = u + f^{F_c}$$

      <p> where $x$ is the position, $u$ the input force applied on the point-mass, and $f^{F_c}$ the contact force from the environment on point ${F}$ applied at $c$. In order to control the position and force from the robot at the same time, the following controller is proposed:</p>

      $$u = \underbrace{k_p(x_d-x) - k_d\dot{x}}_{\text{feedback force for position control}} - \underbrace{f^{F_c}_{desired}}_{\text{feedforward force}}$$

      <p>Define the error for this system to be:</p>

      $$e = (x - x_d)^2 + (f^{F_c} - f^{F_c}_{desired})^2$$

      <ol type="a">
        <li>Let's consider the case where our system is in free space (i.e. $f^{F_c}=0$) and we want to exert a non-zero desired force ($f^{F_c}_{desired} \neq 0$) and drive our position to zero ($x_d = 0$). You wil show that this is not possible, i.e. we cannot achieve zero error for our desired force and desired position. You can show this by considering the steady-state error (i.e. set $\dot{x}=0,\ddot{x}=0$) as a function of the system dynamics, controller, desired position and desired force.</li>
        <li>Now consider the system is in rigid body contact with a wall located at $x_d = 0$ and a desired non-zero force ($f^{F_c}_{desired} > 0$) is being commanded. Considering the steady-state error in this case, show that system can achieve zero error.</li>
      </ol>
    </exercise>

    <exercise><h1>Box Flip-up</h1>
      
      <p> Consider the initial phase of the box flip-up task from the <a href="#force_flip_up">example</a> above, when $\theta\approx 0$. Let $B$ be the box, $A$ be the pivot point of the box, and $C$ be the contact point between the finger and box $B$. We will assume that the forces can still be approximated as axis-aligned, but the ground contact is only being applied at the pivoting point $A$.</p>
      <figure><img style="width:70%" src="figures/exercises/pivot.png"></figure>


      <ol type="a">
        <li> If we do not push hard enough (i.e. $f^{B_C}_{finger,C_z}$ is too small), then we will not be able to create enough friction ($f^{B_C}_{finger,C_x}$) to counteract gravity. By summing the torques around the pivot point $A$, derive a lower bound for the required normal force $f^{B_C}_{finger,C_z}$, as a function of $m,g,$ and $\mu^C$. You may assume that the moment arm of gravity is half that of the moment arm on C, and that the box is square.
        </li>
        <li> If we push too hard (i.e. $f^{B_C}_{finger,C_z}$ is too big), then the pivot point will end up sliding to the left. By writing the force balance along the horizontal axis, derive an upper bound for the required normal force $f^{B_C}_{finger,C_z}$, as a function of $m,g,$ and $\mu^A$. (HINT: It will be necessary to use the torque balance equation from before) </li>

        <li> By combining the lower bounds and upper bounds from the previous problems, derive a relation for $\mu^A,\mu^C$ that must hold in order for this motion to be possible. If $\mu^A\approx 0.25$ (wood-metal), how high does $\mu^C$ have to be in order for the motion to be feasible? What if $\mu^A=1$ (concrete-rubber)?
        </li>
