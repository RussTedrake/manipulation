  <p>There are a few more essential skills that we need in our toolbox.  In this
  chapter, we will explore some of the powerful methods of kinematic trajectory
  motion planning.</p>

  <div>I'm actually almost proud of making it this far into the notes without
  covering this topic yet.  Writing a relatively simple script for the pose of
  the gripper, like we did in the bin picking chapter, really can solve a lot of
  interesting problems.  But there are a number of reasons that we might want a
  more automated solution:
  <ol><li>When the environment becomes more cluttered, it is harder to write
  such a simple solution, and we might have to worry about collisions between
  the arm and the environment as well as the gripper and the environment.</li>
  <li>If we are doing "mobile manipulation" -- our robotic arms are attached to
  a mobile base -- then the robot might have to operate in many different environments.  Even if the workspace is not geometrically complicated,
  it might still be different enough each time we reach that it requires
  automated (but possibly still simple) planning.</li><li>If the robot is
  operating in a simple known environment all day long, then it probably makes
  sense to optimize the trajectories that it is executing; we can often speed up
  the manipulation process significantly.</li>
  </div>

  <p>We'll focus on the problem of moving an arm through space in this chapter,
  because that is the classical and very important motivation.  But I need to
  cover this now for another reason, too: it will also soon help us think about
  programming a more dexterous hand.</p>

  <p>I do need to make one important caveat.  Despite having done some work in
  this field myself, I actually really dislike the problem formulation of
  collision-free motion planning.  I think that on the whole, robots are too
  afraid of bumping into the world (because things still go wrong when they do).
  I don't think humans are solving these complex geometric problems every time
  we reach... even when we are reaching in dense clutter (I actually suspect
  that we are very bad at it). I would much rather see robots that perform well
  even with very coarse / approximate plans for moving through a cluttered
  environment, that are not afraid to make incidental contacts, and that can
  still accomplish the task when they do!</p>

  <section><h1>Inverse Kinematics</h1>

    <p>The goal of this chapter is to solve for motion trajectories.  But I would argue that if you really understand how to solve inverse kinematics, then you've got most of what you need to plan trajectories.</p>

    <p>We know that that the <a href="pick.html#kinematics">forward
    kinematics</a> give us a (nonlinear) mapping from joint angles to e.g. the
    pose of the gripper: $X^G = f_{kin}(q)$.  So, naturally, the problem of
    inverse kinematics (IK) is about solving for the inverse map, $q =
    f^{-1}_{kin}(X^G).$  Indeed, that is perhaps the most common and classical
    question studied in inverse kinematics.  But I want you to think of inverse
    kinematics as a much richer topic than that.</p>

    <p>For example, when we were <a
    href="clutter.html#grasp_candidates">evaluating grasp candidates for bin
    picking</a>, we had only a soft preference on the orientation of the hand
    relative to some antipodal grasp.  In that case, a full 6 DOF pose would
    have been an overly constrained specification.  And often we have many
    constraints on the kinematics: some in joint space (like joint limits) and
    others in Cartesian space (like non-penetration constraints).  So really,
    inverse kinematics is about solving for joint angles in a very rich
    landscape of objectives and constraints.</p>

      <figcaption>We made extensive use of rich inverse kinematics
      specifications in our work on humanoid robots.  The video above is an
      example of the interactive inverse kinematics interface (here to help us
      figure out how to fit the our big humanoid robot into the little Polaris).

    <subsection><h1>From end-effector pose to joint angles</h1>

      <p>With its obvious importance in robotics, you probably won't be
      surprised to hear that there is an extensive literature on inverse
      kinematics.  But you may be surprised at how extensive and complete the
      solutions can get. The forward kinematics, $f_{kin}$, is a nonlinear
      function in general, but it is a very structured one.  In fact, with rare
      exceptions (like if your robot has a <a
      href="https://www.hindawi.com/journals/mpe/2016/1761968/fig4/">helical
      joint</a>, aka screw joint), the equations governing the valid Cartesian
      positions of our robots are actually <i>polynomial</i>.  "But wait!  What
      about all of those sines and cosines in my kinematic equations?" you say.
      The trigonometric terms come when we want to relate joint angles with
      Cartesian coordinates.  In $\Re^3$, for two points, $A$ and $B$, on the
      same rigid body, the (squared) distance between them, $\|p^A - p^B\|^2,$
      is a constant.  And a joint is just a polynomial constraint between
      positions on adjoining bodies, e.g. that they occupy the same point in
      Cartesian space.  See <elib>Wampler11</elib> for an excellent
      overview.</p>

      <todo>example: trig and polynomial kinematics of a two-link arm.</todo>

      <p>Understanding the solutions to polynomial equations is the subject of
      algebraic geometry.  There is a deep literature on the theory, on symbolic
      algorithms, and on numerical algorithms.  For even very complex kinematic
      topologies, such as <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four-bar_linkage">four-bar
      linkages</a> and <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stewart_platform">Stewart-Gough
      platforms</a>, we can count the number of solutions, and/or understand the
      continuous manifold of solutions.  For instance, <elib>Wampler11</elib>
      describes a substantial toolbox for numerical algebraic geometry (based on
      homotopy methods) with impressive results on difficult kinematics
      problems.</p>

      <p>While the algebraic-geometry methods are mostly targeted for offline
      global analysis, they are not designed for fast real-time inverse
      kinematics solutions needed in a control loop.  The most popular tool
      these days for real-time inverse kinematics for six- or seven-DOF
      manipulators is a tool called "IKFast", described in Section 4.1
      of <elib>Diankov10</elib>, that gained popularity because of its effective
      open-source implementation.  Rather than focus on completeness, IKFast
      uses a number of approximations to provide fast and numerically robust
      solutions to the "easy" kinematics problems.  It leverages the fact that a
      six-DOF pose constraint on a six-DOF manipulator has a "closed-form"
      solution with a finite number of joint space configurations that produce
      the same end-effector pose, and for seven-DOF manipulators it adds a layer
      of sampling in the last degree of freedom on top of the six-DOF
      solver.</p>

      <todo>add an example of calling (or implementing something equivalent to)
      IKFast and/or Bertini. looks like bertini 2 has python bindings (but not
      pip) and is GPL3.</todo>

      <p>These explicit solutions are important to understand because they
      provide deep insight into the equations, and because they can be fast
      enough to use inside a more sophisticated solution approach.  But the
      solutions don't provide the rich specification I advocated for above; in
      particular, they break down once we have inequality constraints instead
      of equality constraints.  For those richer specifications, we will turn
      to optimization.</p>

    </subsection>

    <subsection><h1>IK as constrained optimization</h1>

      <figure><img style="width:60%" src="data/shelf_ik.png"><figcaption>A
      richer inverse kinematics problem: solve for the joint angles, $q$, that
      allow the robot to reach into the shelf and grab the object, while
      avoiding collisions.</figcaption></figure>

      <p>We have <a href="pick.html#diff_ik_w_constraints">already
      discussed</a> the idea of solving <i>differential</i> inverse kinematics
      as an optimization problem.  In that workflow, we started by using the
      pseudo-inverse of the kinematic Jacobian, but then graduated to thinking
      about the least-squares formulation of the inverse problem.  The the more
      general least-squares setting, we could add additional costs and
      constraints that would protect us from (nearly) singular Jacobians and
      could take into account additional constraints from joint limits, joint
      velocity limits, etc.  We could even add collision avoidance constraints.
      Some of these constraints are quite nonlinear / nonconvex functions of
      the configuration $q$, but in the differential kinematics setting we were
      only seeking to find a small change $\Delta q$ around the nominal
      configuration, so it was quite reasonable to make linear/convex
      approximations of these nonlinear/nonconvex constraints.
      </p>

      <p>Now we will consider the full formulation, where we try to solve the
      nonlinear / nonconvex optimization directly, without any constraints on
      only making a small change to an initial $q$.  This is a much harder
      problem computationally.  Using powerful nonlinear optimization solvers
      like SNOPT, we are often able to solve the problems, even at interactive
      rates (the example below is quite fun).  But there are no guarantees.  It
      could be that a solution exists even if the solver returns
      "infeasible".</p>

      <p>Of course, the differential IK problem and the full IK problem are
      closely related.  In fact, you can think about the differential IK
      algorithm as doing one step of (projected) gradient descent or  one-step
      of <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequential_quadratic_programming">SQP</a>,
      for the full nonlinear problem.</p>

      <p>Drake provides a nice <a
      href="https://drake.mit.edu/doxygen_cxx/classdrake_1_1multibody_1_1_inverse_kinematics.html"></a>InverseKinematics</a>
      class that makes it easy to assemble many of the standard
      kinematic/multibody constraints into a
      <code>MathematicalProgram</code>.  Take a minute to look at the
      constraints that are offered.  You can add constraints on the relative
      position and/or orientation on two bodies, or that two bodies are more
      than some minimal distance apart (e.g. for non-penetration) or closer
      than some distance, and more.  This is the way that I want you to think
      about the IK problem; it is an inverse problem, but one with a
      potentially very rich set of costs and constraints.</p>

      <example><h1>Interactive IK</h1>

        <p>Despite the nonconvexity of the problem and nontrivial computational
        cost of evaluating the constraints, we can often solve it at
        interactive rates.  I've assembled a few examples of this in the
        chapter notebook:</p>

        <p><a href="https://deepnote.com/project/Ch-8-Motion-Planning-B2KxZ0AqQ2KXAn1Vnw5zuw/%2Ftrajectories.ipynb" style="background:none; border:none;" class="deepnote" target="trajectories">  <img src="https://deepnote.com/buttons/launch-in-deepnote-white.svg"></a></p>

        <p>In the first version, I've added sliders to let you control the
        desired pose of the end-effector.  This is the simple version of the IK
        problem, amenable to more explicit solutions, but we nevertheless solve
        it with our full nonlinear optimization IK engine (and it does include
        joint limit constraints).  This demo won't look too different from the
        very first example in the notes, where you used teleop to command the
        robot to pick up the red brick.  In fact, differential IK offers a fine
        solution to this problem, too.</p>

        <p>In the second example, I've tried to highlight the differences
        between the nonlinear IK problem and the differential IK problem by
        adding an obstacle directly in front of the robot.  Because both our
        differential IK and IK formulations are able to consume the
        collision-avoidance constraints, both solutions will try to prevent you
        from crashing the arm into the post.  But if you move the target
        end-effector position from one side of the post to the other, the full
        IK solver can switch over to a new solution with the arm on the other
        side of the post, but the differential IK will never be able to make
        that leap (it will stay on the first side of the post, refusing to
        allow a collision).</p>

            <img width="40%" src="data/ik_post_2.png"/>
            <figcaption>As the desired end-effector position moves along
            positive $y$, the IK solver is able to find a new solution with the
            arm wrapped the other way around the post.</figcaption>
        </figure>


      </example>

      <p>With great power comes great responsibility.  The inverse kinematics
      toolbox allows you to formulate complex optimizations, but your success
      with solving them will depend partially on how thoughtful you are about
      choosing your costs and constraints.  My basic advice is this: <ol>
      <li>Try to keep the objective (costs) simple; I typically only use the
      "joint-centering" quadratic cost on $q$.  Putting terms that should be
      constraints into the cost as penalties leads to lots of cost-function
      tuning, which can be a nasty business.</li><li>Write minimal constraints.
      You want the set of feasible configurations to be as big as possible.
      For instance, if you don't need to fully constrain the orientation of the
      gripper, then don't do it.</li></ol>  I'll follow-up with that second
      point using the following example.</p>

      <example><h1>Grasp the cylinder.</h1>
      
        <p><a href="https://deepnote.com/project/Ch-8-Motion-Planning-B2KxZ0AqQ2KXAn1Vnw5zuw/%2Ftrajectories.ipynb" style="background:none; border:none;" class="deepnote" target="trajectories">  <img src="https://deepnote.com/buttons/launch-in-deepnote-white.svg"></a></p>

      </example>

      <p>Global IK.</p>      

      <p>When should we use IK vs Differential IK?  IK solves a more global
      problem, but is not guaranteed to succeed.  It is also not guaranteed to
      make small changes to $q$ as you make small changes in the
      cost/constraints; so you might end up sending large $\Delta q$ commands
      to your robot.  Use IK when you need to solve the more global problem,
      but then produce the actual $q$ trajectories with trajectory
      optimization, etc.  Or use differential IK if you are able to design
      smooth commands in end-effector space and simply track them in joint
      space.</p>

    </exercise>    

    <exercise><h1>Improving RRT Path Quality</h1>
      <p>Due to the random process by which nodes are generated, the paths output by RRT can often look somewhat jerky (the "RRT dance" is the favorite dance move of many roboticists). There are many strategies to improve the quality of the paths and in this question we'll explore two. For the sake of this problem, we'll assume path quality refers to path length, i.e. that the goal is to find the shortest possible path, where distance is measured as Euclidean distance in joint space. </p>
      <ol type="a">
        <li> One strategy to improve path quality is to post-process paths via "shortcutting", which tries to replace existing portions of a path with shorter segments <elib>Geraerts04</elib>. This is often implemented with the following algorithm: 1) Randomly select two non-consecutive nodes along the path. If these two nodes 2) Try to connect them with a RRT's extend operator 3) If the resulting path is better, replace the existing path with the new, better path. Steps 1-3 are repeated until a termination condition (often a finite number of steps or time). For this problem, we can assume that the extend operator is a straight line in joint space. Consider the graph below, where RRT has found a rather jerky path from $q_{start}$ to $q_{goal}$. There is an obstacle (shown in red) and $q_{start}$ and $q_{goal}$ are highlighted in blue (disclaimer: This graph was manually generated to serve as an illustrative example).

          <img style="width:80%", src="data/shortcutting.png"/>
      </figure>
Name one pair of nodes for which the shortcutting algorithm would result in a shorter path (i.e. two nodes along our current solution path for which we could produce a shorter path if we were to directly connect them). You should assume the distance metric is the 2D Euclidean distance.</li><br/>
        <li> Shortcutting as a post-processing technique, reasons over the existing path and enables local "re-wiring" of the graph. It is a heuristic and does not, however, guarantee that the tree will encode the shortest path. To explore this, let's zoom in one one iteration of RRT (as illustrated below), where $q_{sample}$ is the randomly generated configuration, $q_{near}$ was the closest node on the existing tree and $q_{new}$ is the RRT extension step from $q_{near}$ in the direction of q_sample. When the standard RRT algorithm (which you implemented in <a href="#rrtExercise">a previous exercise</a>) adds $q_{new}$ to the tree, what node is its parent? If we wanted our tree to encode the shortest path from the starting node, $q_{start}$, to each node in the tree, what node should be the parent node of $q_{new}$?</li>

      </figure>
      </ol>
      This idea of dynamically "rewiring" to discover the minimum cost path (which for us is the shortest distance) is a critical aspect of the asymptotically optimal variant of RRT known as RRT* <elib>Karaman11</elib>. As the number of samples tends towards infinity RRT* finds the optimal path to the goal! This is unlike "plain" RRT, which is provably suboptimal (the intuition for this proof is that RRT "traps" itself because it cannot find better paths as it searches).
