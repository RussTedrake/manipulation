Compute a grasp frame $T$ that has the relative transformation `X_FT=(RotateZ(phi),TranslateX(x))`. Convince yourself this makes the point $p$ stay in the \"closing plane\" (drawn in red) defined in the figure above.

    "5. If $G$ results in no collisions (see `check_collision`) and results in non-empty grasp (use `check_nonempty`), append it to the candidate list. If not, continue the loop until we have desired number of candidates. \n"
