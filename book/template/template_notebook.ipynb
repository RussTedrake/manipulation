    "- To use this in your own workspace, click “Duplicate” for the project in Deepnote.\n",
    "- Class dependencies, namely `drake` and the `manipulation` package, are already preinstalled in the Deepnote image for this course, as well as a bunch of other dependencies that these packages depend on or that we use in class\n",

    "Here we show you how to install additional packages into this Deepnote project. We will use the package [gcsopt](https://pypi.org/project/gcsopt/) as an example. To install additional dependencies, you have two choices\n",
    "- **Recommended:** Add the dependency to the list of dependencies in `reqirements.txt` on the left. The dependency will then be automatically installed whenever you boot up a new Deepnote machine.\n",
    "  - **Note**: Make sure to NOT remove the text that is already in the file. You should add your dependencies AFTER `manipulation=year.month.day`, separated by spaces.\n",
    "- **Alternatively:** Run `!pip install gcsopt` within a cell in the Deepnote notebook. You will have to do this everytime you restart your Deepnote machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "### (Advanced Users) Updating the `manipulation` version\n",
    "We continually add new features to the `manipulation` package, which is automatically updated in Deepnote. However, after you first click \"Duplicate\", you will stop receiving these updates. Follow these steps to update your version to the latest version:\n",
    "1. Find the latest version number for `manipulation` on the [PyPi package page](https://pypi.org/project/manipulation/#history).\n",
    "2. Update the version number for `manipulation=year.month.day` in the `requirements.txt` file on the left\n",
    "3. Run the `Init` notebook OR restart your Deepnote machine.\n",
    "The changes will now persist every time you start your Deepnote machine.\n",
