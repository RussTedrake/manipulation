<chapter style="counter-reset: chapter 10"><h1>Reinforcement Learning</h1>
  <div style="clear:right;"></div>

  <p>These days, there is a lot of excitement around reinforcement learning
  (RL), and a lot of literature available.  The scope of what one might
  consider to be a reinforcement learning algorithm has also broaden
  significantly. The classic (and now updated) and still best introduction to
  RL is the book by Sutton and Barto <elib>Sutton18</elib> .  For a more
  theoretical view, try <elib>Agarwal20b+Szepesvari10</elib>.  There
  are some great online courses, as well: <a
  href="http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs234/">Stanford CS234</a>, <a
  href="https://rail.eecs.berkeley.edu/deeprlcourse/">Berkeley CS285</a>, <a
  href="https://deepmind.com/learning-resources/-introduction-reinforcement-learning-david-silver">DeepMind
  x UCL</a>.</p>

  <p>My goal for this chapter is to provide enough of the fundamentals to get
  us all on the same page, but to focus primarily on the RL ideas (and
  examples) that are particularly relevant for manipulation.  And manipulation
  is a great playground for RL, due to the need for rich perception, for
  operating in diverse environments, and potentially with rich contact
  mechanics.  Many of the core applied research results have been motivated by
  and demonstrated on manipulation examples!</p>

  <section><h1>RL Software</h1>
  
    <p>There are now a huge variety of RL toolboxes available online, with
    widely varying levels of quality and sophistication.  But there is one
    standard that has clearly won out as the default interface with which one
    should wrap up their simulator in order to connect to a variety of RL
    algorithms: the <a href="https://gymnasium.farama.org/">Gymnasium</a>
    (which is often still called "Gym" for short).</p>

    <p>It's worth taking a minute to appreciate the difference in the 
    Gymnasium <a href="https://gymnasium.farama.org/api/env/">Environments</a>
    (<code>gymnasium.Env</code>) interface and the Drake System interface; I
    think it is very telling.  My goal (in Drake), is to present you with a
    rich and beautiful interface to express and optimize dynamical systems, to
    expose and exploit all possible structure in the governing equations.  The
    goal in Gym is to expose the absolute minimal details, so that it's
    possible to easily wrap every possible system under the same common
    interface (it doesn't matter if it's a robot, an Atari game, or even a <a
    href="https://github.com/facebookresearch/CompilerGym">compiler</a>).
    Almost by definition, you can wrap any Drake system as a Gym
    environment.</p>  

    <example id="drake_gym">
      <h1>Using a Drake simulation as an Gym environment</h1>
    
      <p>A Gym environment is an incredibly simple wrapper around simulators
      which offers a <a
      href="https://github.com/openai/gym/blob/6a04d49722724677610e36c1f92908e72f51da0c/gym/core.py#L35">very
      basic interface</a>, most notably consisting of <code>reset()</code>,
      <code>step()</code>, <code>render()</code>. The
      <code>step()</code> method returns the current observations and the
      one-step reward (as well as some additional termination conditions).
      </p>

      <p>You can wrap any Drake simulation in an OpenAI gym environment, using 
      <pre><code class="python">from pydrake.gym import DrakeGymEnv</code></pre>
      The <a
      href="https://drake.mit.edu/pydrake/pydrake.gym.html?highlight=drakegym#pydrake.gym.DrakeGymEnv"><code>DrakeGymEnv</code>
      constructor</a> takes a <code>Simulator</code> as well as an input port
      to associate with the actions, an output port to associate with the
      observations, etc. For the reward, you can implement it as a simple function of the <code>Simulator</code>
      <code>Context</code>, or as another output port.
      </p>

      <p><code>DrakeGymEnv</code> is built around a <code>Simulator</code>
      (not just a <code>System</code>) or a function that produces a random
      <code>Simulator</code> because you might want to control the integrator
      parameters or have each rollout contain the same robot in a different
      environment, with potentially different numbers of objects. This would
      mean that the underlying <code>System</code> might have a different
      number of states / ports. The notion of a function that can produce
      simulators, referred to as a <code>SimulatorFactory</code>, is core to
      the <a
      href="https://drake.mit.edu/doxygen_cxx/group__stochastic__systems.html">stochastic
      system modeling framework</a> in Drake.</p>
    
    </example>
    
    <p>You can also use any Gym environment in the Drake ecosystem; you just
    won't be able to apply some of the more advanced algorithms that Drake
    provides.  Of course, I think that you should use Drake for your work in
    RL, too (many people do), because it provides a the rich library of
    dynamical systems that are rigorously authored and tested, including a
    great physics engine for dealing with contact, and leaves open the option
    to put RL approaches head-to-head against more model-based alternatives. I
    admit I might be a little biased. At any rate, that's the approach we will
    take in these notes.</p>
    
    <p>Some people <a
    href="http://www.incompleteideas.net/IncIdeas/BitterLesson.html">might
    argue</a> that the more thoughtfully you model your system, the more
    assumptions you have baked in, making yourself susceptible to "sim2real"
    gaps; but I think that's simply not the case.  Thoughtful modeling includes
    making uncertainty models that can account for as narrow or broad of a
    class of systems as we aim to explore; good things happen when we can make
    the uncertainty models themselves <i>structured</i>. I think one of the
    most fundamental challenges waiting for us at the intersection of
    reinforcement learning and control is a deeper understanding of the class
    of models that is rich enough to describe the diversity and richness of
    problems we are exploring in manipulation (e.g. with RGB cameras as inputs)
    while providing somewhat more structure that we can exploit with stronger
    algorithms.  Importantly, these models should continually expand and
    improve with data.</p>  <todo>callout to intuitive physics chapter once it
    exists</todo>

    <!-- another point: the RL approach has been successful in part because
    it's easy.  approachable with less training, and as a result got more
    people/funding put against it. that's super valuable.  controls as a field,
    on the other hand, has made itself somewhat intentionally obscure, perhaps
    partly out of arrogance.  that is perhaps the more bitter lesson.  -->

    <p>Gymnasium provides an interface for RL environments, but doesn't
    provide the implementation of the actual RL algorithms.  There are a large
    number of popular repositories for the algorithms, too.  As of this
    writing, I would recommend <a
    href="https://stable-baselines3.readthedocs.io/en/master/index.html">Stable
    Baselines 3</a>: it provides a very nice and thoughtfully-documented set of
    implementations in PyTorch.</p>

    <!--
      - the env interface is now standard, but the policy interface is not.
        everyone rolls their own, and mostly assumes nn.Module as a base class.
      - SB3 lets you define a custom "policy" (actually policy + value func),
        but doesn't currently support dynamic policies (LSTM was removed at
        some point; hopefully it will come back)
      - I really dislike that the notion of value function and Q function are
        applied directly to observations.  (In SB3, but most other packages,
        too).  That's bad form.
      -->


    <p>One other class of algorithms that is very relevant to RL but not
    specifically designed for RL is algorithms for black-box optimization.  I
    quite like <a
    href="https://facebookresearch.github.io/nevergrad/">Nevergrad</a>, and
    will also use that here.</p>

      <p>This is a great time for theoretical RL + controls, with experts from

      vice versa.  As a simple example, we've increasingly come to understand
      that, even though the cost landscape for many classical control problems
      (like the linear quadratic regulator) is not convex in the typical policy
      parameters, we <a

      understand that gradient descent still works</a> for these problems
      (there are no local minima), and the class of problems/parameterizations
      for which we can make statements like this is growing rapidly.</p>

    <exercise><h1>Stochastic Optimization</h1>
      <p> For this exercise, you will implement a stochastic optimization scheme that does not require exact analytical gradients. You will work exclusively in <script>document.write(notebook_link('rl', notebook='stochastic_optimization', link_text='this notebook'))</script>. You will be asked to complete the following steps: </p>
      <ol type="a">
        <li> Implement gradient descent with exact analytical gradients.
        </li>

        </li>
      </ol>
    </exercise>    

    <exercise><h1>REINFORCE</h1>
      <p> For this exercise, you will implement the vanilla REINFORCE algorithm on a box pushing task. You will work exclusively in <script>document.write(notebook_link('rl', notebook='policy_gradient', link_text='this notebook'))</script>. You will be asked to complete the following steps: </p>
      <ol type="a">
        <li> Implement the policy loss function. </li>
        <li> Implement the value loss function. </li>
        <li> Implement the advantage function. </li>
      </ol>
    </exercise>
    <exercise id="rl-box-flipup"><h1>Analyzing Box Flipping with RL</h1>
      In this exercise, you will analyze the behavior of a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.06347">PPO</a> policy trained to flip over a box. Like REINFORCE, PPO is a policy-gradient method that
      directly optimizes the policy parameters to maximize the value function. In order to have an easier problem to analyze,
      we'll use the <a href="https://manipulation.csail.mit.edu/force.html#force_flip_up">box flipup example</a> from Chapter 8. Our robot will be a simple point finger and 
      the goal will be to flip over the box. You can find the code used to train the policy <a href="https://github.com/RussTedrake/manipulation/blob/master/book/rl/train_boxflipup.py">here</a>.
      <ol type="a">
        <li> Take a look at the <a href="https://github.com/RussTedrake/manipulation/blob/master/manipulation/envs/box_flipup.py">code</a> used to generate the environment. 
          Let $\theta$ denote the angle of the box from the vertical, $\omega$ denote the angular velocity of the box, $q_f$ denote the observed position of the finger, 
          $v_f$ denote the velocity of the finger, and $u_f$ denote the commanded position of the finger. What is the reward function used here to train the policy? 
          Write it down mathematically (use the modulo operator to handle the ''wrapping around'' of the angle). What do the individual terms in the reward
          function represent? Why do they make sense?</li>
        <li> Although we will not go into the exact details of how PPO works here, it works quite similarly to REINFORCE but using both (i) a learned value function to reduce variance, and (ii) an approximate
          objective, along with a ''trust region'' constraint by clipping the per-sample loss to ensure that the policy is not updated too much at each step. Briefly explain why you think that 
          (a) PPO might be more stable and sample efficient than REINFORCE, and (b) how you might expect PPO to perform on the box flipping task if the clipping limits are set to be too small or too large.</li>
        <li> We've trained a PPO-based policy to flip the box for 3,000,000 steps (see 
          <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOZK7fx6sI6lvDalINByA_kbYfBxn76by&si=XUndO5UDHMJcywr2">here</a> for videos of the
          policy in action at each of the timesteps). How does the policy perform as the number of steps increases? Write qualitatively
          how the policy changes over time and which parts of the reward function are having the greatest effect at each step.
        </li>
      </ol>
      Notice how much time it takes to train a working policy, even for a simple manipulation problem like the 2D box flipping example with a point finger and a dense reward. 
      Harder problems in manipulation (such as pick and place) can become extremely challenging to train naïvely with Reinforcement Learning, especially with 
      sparse rewards such as in typical pick and place tasks where you only receive a reward when the object has been picked or placed in the right location. On the other hand,
      reinforcement learning can work well in contact-rich settings (as in the box flipping example); see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4O8pojMF0w">RL solving a rubik's cube with one hand</a>
      for an example of RL being used to solve a contact-rich manipulation task (note this also depended heavily on things like domain randomization, curriculum learning, large scale compute, etc.).
      The story in locomotion, on the other hand, seems to be quite different, perhaps because it is easier to design dense rewards and to automate resets in simulation.
