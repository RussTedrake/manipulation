    <figcaption>Your challenge: command the robot to pick up the brick and place
    it in a desired position/orientation.</figcaption>
    <todo>Update this image once we get a better schunk model.</todo>
  </figure>

  <p>The stage is set.  You have your robot.  I have a little red foam brick.
  I'm going to put it on the table in front of your robot, and your goal is to
  move it to a desired position/orientation on the table.  I want to defer the
  <i>perception</i> problem for one more chapter, and will let you assume that
  you have access to a perfect measurement of the current position/orientation
  of the brick.  Even without perception, completing this task requires us to
  build up a basic toolkit for geometry and kinematics; it's a natural place to
  start.</p>

  <p>First, we will establish some terminology and notation for kinematics. This
  is one area where careful notation can yield dividends, and sloppy notation
  will inevitably lead to confusion and bugs.  The Drake developers have gone to
  great length to establish and document a consistent <a
  href="https://drake.mit.edu/doxygen_cxx/group__multibody__notation.html">
  multibody notation</a>, which we call "Monogram Notation".  The documentation
  even includes some of the motivation/philosophy behind that notation. I'll use
  the monogram notation throughout this text.</p>
  
  <p>If you'd like a more extensive background on kinematics than what I provide
  here, my favorite reference is still <elib>Craig05</elib>.  For free online
  resources, Chapters 2 and 3 of the 1994 book by Murray et al. (now free
  online)<elib>Murray94</elib> are also excellent, as are the first seven
  chapters of <a
  href="http://hades.mech.northwestern.edu/index.php/Modern_Robotics">Modern
  Robotics</a> by Lynch and Park<elib>Lynch17</elib> (they also have excellent
  accompanying videos).  Unfortunately, with three different references you'll
  get three (slightly) different notations; ours is most similar to
  <elib>Craig05</elib>. The monogram notation is developed in some detail in
  <elib>Mitiguy17</elib>.</p>
    
  <p>Please don't get overwhelmed by how much background material there is to
  know!  I am personally of the opinion that a clear understanding of just a few
  basic ideas should make you very effective here.  The details will come
  later, if you need them.</p>    

  <section id="monogram"><h1>Monogram Notation</h1>

    <p><i>The following concepts are disarmingly subtle. I've seen incredibly
    smart people assume they knew them and then perpetually stumble over
    notation.  I did it for years myself.  Take a minute to read this
    carefully!</i></p>

    <p>Perhaps the most fundamental concept in geometry is the concept of a
    point.  Points occupy a position in space, and they can have names, e.g.
    point $A$, $C$, or more descriptive names like $B_{cm}$ for the center of
    mass of body $B$. We'll denote the position of the point by using a position
    vector $p^A$; that's $p$ for position, and not for point, because other
    geometric quantities can also have a position.</p>

    <p>But let's be more careful.  Position is actually a relative quantity.
    Really, we should only ever write the position of two points relative to
    each other. We'll use e.g. $^Ap^C$ to denote the position of $C$ measured
    from $A$.  The left superscript looks mighty strange, but we'll see that it
    pays off once we start transforming points.</p>
    
    <p>Every time we describe the (relative) position as a vector of numbers,
    we need to be explicit about the frame we are using, specifically the
    "expressed-in" frame. All of our frames are defined by orthogonal unit
    vectors that follow the "right-hand rule". We'll give a frame a name, too,
    like $F$.  If I want to write the position of point $C$ measured from point
    $A$, expressed in frame $F$, I will write $^Ap^C_F$. If I ever want to get
    just a single component of that vector, e.g. the $x$ component, then I'll
    use $^Ap^C_{F_x}$. In some sense, the "expressed-in" frame is an
    implementation detail; it is only required once we want to represent the
    multibody quantity as a vector (e.g. in the computer).</p>
    
    <p>That is seriously heavy notation.  I don't love it myself, but it's
    the most durable I've got, and we'll have shorthand for when the context is
    clear.</p>

    <p><img style="height:90px;float:left;margin-right:10px"
    src="figures/frames.png"/> There are a few very special frames. We use $W$
    to denote the <i>world frame</i>.  We think about the world frame in Drake
    using vehicle coordinates (positive $x$ to the front, positive $y$ to the
    <i>left</i>, and positive $z$ is up).  The other particularly special
    frames are the <i>body frames</i>: every body in the multibody physics
    engine has a unique frame attached to it.  We'll typically use $B_i$ to
    denote the frame for body $i$.</p>

    <p>Frames have a position, too -- it coincides with the frame origin.  So it
    is perfectly valid to write $^Wp^A_W$ to denote the position of point $A$
    measured from the origin of the world frame, expressed in the world frame.
    Here is where the shorthand comes in.  If the position of a quantity is
    measured from a frame, and expressed in the same frame, then we can safely
    omit the subscript.  $^Fp^A \equiv {^Fp^A_F}$. Furthermore,
    if the "measured from" field is omitted, then we assume that the point is
    measured from $W$, so $p^A \equiv {}^Wp^A_W$.</p>

    <figure>
      <img style="width:60%" src="figures/notation.svg"></img>
      <!-- Note: I made this in slides.com, exported to pdf, cropped in acrobat,
      then converted with pdf2svg. -->
    </figure>

    <p>Frames also have an orientation.  We'll use $R$ to denote a
    <i>rotation</i>, and follow the same notation, writing $^BR^A$ to denote
    the orientation of frame $A$ measured from frame $B$.  Unlike vectors, pure
    rotations do not have an additional "expressed in" frame.</p>

    <p>A frame $F$ can be specified completely by a position and rotation
    measured from another frame.  Taken together, we call the position and
    orientation a <a
    href="https://drake.mit.edu/doxygen_cxx/group__multibody__spatial__pose.html">
    <i>spatial pose</i></a>, or just <i>pose</i>.  A <i>spatial transform</i>,
    or just <i>transform</i>, is the "verb form" of pose.  In Drake we use <a
    href="https://drake.mit.edu/doxygen_cxx/classdrake_1_1math_1_1_rigid_transform.html"><code>RigidTransform</code></a>
    to represent a pose/transform, and denote it with the letter $X$. $^BX^A$
    is the pose of frame $A$ measured from frame $B$.  When we talk about the
    pose of an object $O$, without mentioning a reference frame explicitly, we
    mean $^WX^O$ where $O$ is the body frame of the object.  We do not use the
    "expressed in" frame subscript for pose; we always want the pose expressed
    in the reference frame.</p>
    
    <p>The Drake <a
    href="https://drake.mit.edu/doxygen_cxx/group__multibody__notation.html">
    documentation</a> also discusses how to use this notation in code. In
    short, $^Bp^A_C$ is written <code>p_BA_C</code>, ${}^BR^A$ as
    <code>R_BA</code>, and ${}^BX^A$ as <code>X_BA</code>. It works, I
    promise.</p>

  </section>

  <section><h1>Pick and place via spatial transforms</h1>
  
    <p>Now that we have the notation, we can formulate our approach to the basic
    pick and place problem.  Let us call our object, $O$, and our gripper, $G$.
    Our idealized perception sensor tells us $^WX^O$.  Let's create a frame
    $O_d$ to describe the "desired" pose of the object, $^WX^{O_d}$.
    So pick and place manipulation is simply trying to make $X^O = X^{O_d}$.</p>
    
    <todo>Add a figure here (after Terry's PR lands).</todo>

    <div>To accomplish this, we will assume that the object doesn't move
    relative to the world ($^WX^O$ is constant) when the gripper is open, and
    the object doesn't move relative to the gripper ($^GX^O$ is constant) when
    the gripper is closed.  Then we can:
      <ul style="margin:0"><li>move the gripper in the world, $X^G$, to an
      appropriate pose measured from the object: $^OX^{G_{grasp}}$.</li>
      <li>close the gripper.</li>
      <li>move the gripper+object to the desired pose, $X^O = X^{O_d}$.</li>
      <li>open the gripper, and retract the hand.</li>
      </ul>
    There is just one more important detail: to approach the object without
    colliding with it, we will insert a "pregrasp pose", $^OX^{G_{pregrasp}}$,
    above the object as an intermediate step.  We'll use the same transform to
    retract away from the object when we set it down.
    </div>

    <p>Clearly, programming this strategy requires good tools for working with
    these transforms, and for relating the pose of the gripper to the joint
    angles of the robot.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="spatial_algebra"><h1>Spatial Algebra</h1>
  
    <p>Here is where we start to see the pay-off from our heavy notation, as we
    define the rules of converting positions, rotations, poses, etc. between
    different frames.  Without the notation, this invariably involves
    me with my right hand in the air making the "right-hand rule", and my head
    twisting around in space.  With the notation, it's a simple matter of lining
    up the symbols properly, and we're more likely to get the right answer!</p>
  
    <div>
    Here are the basic rules of algebra for our spatial quantities:  
    <ul>
      <li>Positions expressed in the same frame can be added when their
      reference and target symbols match: \begin{equation}{}^Ap^B_F + {}^Bp^C_F
      = {}^Ap^C_F.\end{equation} Addition is commutative, and the additive
      inverse is well defined: \begin{equation}{}^Ap^B_F = -
      {}^Bp^A_F.\end{equation} Those should be pretty intuitive; make sure you
      confirm them for yourself.</li>
      <li>Multiplication by a rotation can be used to change the "expressed in"
      frame: \begin{equation}{}^Ap^B_G = {}^GR^F {}^Ap^B_F.\end{equation}  You
      might be surprised that a rotation alone is enough to change the
      expressed-in frame, but it's true. The position of the expressed-in frame
      does <i>not</i> affect the relative position between two points.</li>
      <li>Rotations can be multiplied when their reference and target symbols
      match: \begin{equation}{}^AR^B \: {}^BR^C = {}^AR^C.\end{equation}  The
      inverse operation is also simply defined:
      \begin{equation}\left[{}^AR^B\right]^{-1} = {}^BR^A.\end{equation} When
      the rotation is represented as a rotation matrix, this is literally the
      matrix inverse, and since rotation matrices are orthonormal, we also have
      $R^{-1}=R^T.$</li>
      <li>Transforms bundle this up into a single, convenient notation when
      positions are measured from a frame (and the same frame they are expressed
      in): \begin{equation}{}^Gp^A = {}^GX^F {}^Fp^A = {}^Gp^F + {}^Fp^A_G
      = {}^Gp^F + {}^GR^F {}^Fp^A.\end{equation}</li>
      <li>Transforms compose: \begin{equation}{}^AX^B {}^BX^C =
      {}^AX^C,\end{equation}  and have an inverse
      \begin{equation}\left[{}^AX^B\right]^{-1} = {}^BX^A.\end{equation}  Please
      note that for transforms, we generally do
      <i>not</i> have that $X^{-1}$ is $X^T,$ though it still has a simple form.
    </li>
    </ul></div>

    <p>In practice, transforms are implemented using <a
    href="https://drake.mit.edu/doxygen_cxx/group__multibody__spatial__pose.html">homogenous
    coordinates</a>, but for now I'm happy to leave that as an implementation
    detail.</p>

    <example><h1>From camera frame to world frame</h1>
      
      <todo>Add a figure here.</todo>

      <p>Imagine that I have a depth camera mounted in a fixed pose in my
      workspace.  Let's call the camera frame $C$ and denote its pose in the
      world with ${}^WX^C$.</p>

      <p>A depth camera returns points in the camera frame.  Therefore,
      we'll write this position of point $P_i$ with ${}^Cp^{P_i}$.  If we want
      to convert the point into the world frame, we simply have $$p^{P_i}
      = X^C {}^Cp^{P_i}.$$</p>

      <p>This is a work-horse operation for us.  We often aim to merge points
      from multiple cameras (typically in the world frame), and always need to
      somehow relate the frames of the camera with the frames of the robot. The
      inverse transform, ${}^CX^W$, which projects world coordinates into the
      camera frame, is often called the camera "extrinsics".</p>
    
    </example>

    <subsection id="3D_rotation"><h1>Representations for 3D rotation</h1>
    
      <p>In the spatial algebra above, I've written the rules for rotations
      using an abstract notion of rotation.  But in order to implement this
      algebra in code, we need to decide how we are going to represent those
      representations with a small number of real values.  There are <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_formalisms_in_three_dimensions">many
      possible representations of 3D rotations</a>, they are each good for
      different operations, and unfortunately, there is no one representation
      to rule them all. (This is one of the many reasons why everything is
      better in 2D!) Common representations include <ul><li><a
      href="https://drake.mit.edu/doxygen_cxx/classdrake_1_1math_1_1_rotation_matrix.html">3$\times$3
      rotation matrices</a>,</li>
      <li><a
      href="https://drake.mit.edu/doxygen_cxx/classdrake_1_1math_1_1_roll_pitch_yaw.html">Euler
      angles (e.g. roll-pitch-yaw)</a>,</li><li><a
      href="https://devdocs.io/eigen3/classeigen_1_1angleaxis">axis
      angle</a> (aka "exponential coordinates"), and </li><li><a
      href="https://devdocs.io/eigen3/classeigen_1_1quaternion">unit
      quaternions</a>.</li></ul> In Drake, we provide all of these
      representations, and make it easy to convert back and forth between
      them.</p>
      
      <p>A 3$\times$3 <a
      href="https://drake.mit.edu/doxygen_cxx/group__multibody__spatial__pose.html#orientation_discussion">rotation
      matrix</a> is an orthonormal matrix with columns formed by the $x-$,
      $y-$, and $z-$axes. Specifically, the first column of the transform
      ${}^GR^F$ has the $x-$axis of frame $F$ expressed in $G$ in the first
      column, etc.</p>

      <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_angles">Euler angles</a>
      specify a 3D rotation by a series of rotations around the $x$, $y$, and
      $z$ axes. The order of these rotations matters; and many combinations can be used to describe any 3D rotation. This is why we use
      <code>RollPitchYaw</code> in the code (preferring it over the more
      general term "Euler angle") and <a
      href="https://drake.mit.edu/doxygen_cxx/classdrake_1_1math_1_1_roll_pitch_yaw.html">document
      it carefully</a>. Roll is a rotation around the $x$-axis, pitch is a
      rotation around the $y$-axis, and yaw is a rotation around the $z$-axis;
      this is also known as "extrinsic X-Y-Z" Euler angles.</p>
      
      <p>Axis angles describe a 3D rotation by a scalar rotation around an
      arbitrary vector axis using three numbers: the direction of the vector is
      the axis, and the magnitude of the vector is the angle. You can think of
      unit quaternions as a form of axis angles that have been carefully
      normalized to be unit length and have magical properties. My favorite
      careful description of quaternions is probably chapter 1 of
      <elib>Stillwell08</elib>.</p>

      <p>Why all of the representations? Shouldn't "roll-pitch-yaw" be enough?
      Unfortunately, no. The limitation is perhaps most easily seen by looking
      at the coordinate changes from roll-pitch-yaw to/from a rotation matrix.
      Any roll-pitch-yaw can be converted to a rotation matrix, but the inverse
      map has a singularity. In particular, when the pitch angle is
      $\frac{\pi}{2}$, then roll and yaw are now indistinguishable. This is
      described very nicely, along with its physical manifestation in "gimbal
      lock" in <a
      href="https://robotacademy.net.au/lesson/singularity-in-3d-rotation-angle-sequences/">this
      video</a>. Similarly, the direction of the vector in the axis-angle
      representation is not uniquely defined when the rotation angle is zero.
      These singularities become problematic when we start taking derivatives
      of rotations, for instance when we write the equations of motion. It is
      now well understood <elib>Stillwell08</elib> that it requires at least
      four numbers to properly represent the group of 3D rotations; the unit
      quaternion is the most common four-element representation.

  <section id="kinematics"><h1>Forward kinematics</h1>
  
    <p>The spatial algebra gets us pretty close to what we need for our pick and
    place algorithm.  But remember that the interface we have with the robot
    reports measured joint positions, and expects commands in the form of joint
    positions.  So our remaining task is to convert between joint angles and
    cartesian frames.  We'll do this in steps, the first step is to go from
    joint positions to cartesian frames: this is known as <i>forward
    kinematics</i>.

    <p>Throughout this text, we will refer to the joint positions of the robot
    (also known as "configuration" of the robot) using a vector $q$.  If the
    configuration of the scene includes objects in the environment as well as
    the robot, we would use $q$ for the entire configuration vector, and use
    e.g. $q_{robot}$ for the subset of the vector corresponding to the robot's
    joint positions. Therefore, the goal of forward kinematics is to produce a
    map: \begin{equation}X^G = f_{kin}^G(q).\end{equation}  Moreover, we'd like
    to have forward kinematics available for any frame we have defined in the
    scene.  Our spatial notation and spatial algebra makes this computation
    relatively straight-forward.</p>

    <subsection id="kinematic_tree"><h1>The kinematic tree</h1>

      <p>In order to facilitate kinematics and related multibody computations,
      the <code>MultibodyPlant</code> organizes all of the bodies in the world
      into a tree topology.  Every body (except the world body) has a parent,
      which it is connected to via either a <code>Joint</code> or a "floating
      base".</p>

      <example><h1>Inspecting the kinematic tree</h1>

        <p>Drake provides some visualization support for inspecting the
        kinematic tree data structure.  The kinematic tree for an iiwa is more
        of a vine than a tree (it's a serial manipulator), but the tree for the
        dexterous hands are more interesting.  I've added our brick to the
        example, too, so that you can see that a "free" body is just another
        branch off the world root node.</p>

        <script>document.write(notebook_link('pick', notebook="kinematic_tree"))</script>
    
        <todo>Insert topology visualization here (once it is better)</todo>
      </example>

      <p>Every <code>Joint</code> and "floating base" has some number of
      position variables associated with it -- a subset of the configuration
      vector $q$ -- and knows how to compute the configuration dependent
      transform across the joint from the child joint frame $J_C$ to the parent
      joint frame $J_P$: ${}^{J_P}X^{J_C}(q)$.  Additionally, the kinematic tree
      defines the (fixed) transforms from the joint frame to the child body
      frame, ${}^CX^{J_C}$, and from the joint frame to the parent frame,
      ${}^PX^{J_P}$. Altogether, we can compute the configuration transform
      between any one body and its parent, $${}^PX^C(q) = {}^PX^{J_P}
      {}^{J_P}X^{J_C}(q) {}^{J_C}X^C.$$</p>

      <todo>
        Examples or links to specifying the kinematic tree in URDF, SDF, etc...
      </todo>

      <p>You might be tempted to think that every time you add a joint to the
      <code>MultibodyPlant</code>, you are adding a degree of freedom.  But it
      actually works the other way around.  Every time you add a <i>body</i>
      to the plant, you are adding many degrees of freedom.  But you can then
      add joints to <i>remove</i> those degrees of freedom; joints are
      constraints.  "Welding" the robot's base to the world frame removes all of
      the floating degrees of freedom of the base.  Adding a rotational joint
      between a child body and a parent body removes all but one degree of
      freedom, etc.</p>

      <example><h1>Forward kinematics for the gripper frame</h1>
      
        <p>Let's evaluate the pose of the gripper in the world frame: $X^G$.
        We know that it will be a function of configuration of the robot, which
        is just a part of the total state of the <code>MultibodyPlant</code>
        (and so is stored in the <code>Context</code>).  The following example
        shows you how it works.</p>

        <script>document.write(notebook_link('pick', notebook="forward_kinematics"))</script>

        <p>The key lines are 
          <code class="language-python"><pre>
gripper = plant.GetBodyByName("body", wsg)
pose = plant.EvalBodyPoseInWorld(context, gripper)</pre></code>
        Behind the scenes, the <code>MultibodyPlant</code> is doing all of the
        spatial algebra we described above to return the pose (and also some
        clever caching because you can reuse much of the computation when you
        want to evaluate the pose of another frame on the same robot).  
        </p>

      <example id="floating-base"><h1>Forward kinematics of "floating-base" objects</h1>
      
        <p>Consider the special case of having a <code>MultibodyPlant</code>
        with exactly one body added, and no joints.  The kinematic tree is
        simply the world frame, the body frame, and they are connected by the
        "floating base".  What does the forward kinematics function: $$X^B =
        f_{kin}^B(q),$$ look like in that case?  If $q$ is already representing
        the floating-base configuration, is $f^B_{kin}$ just the identity
        function?</p>

        <p>This gets into the subtle points of how we represent transforms, and
        <a href="#3D_rotation">how we represent 3D rotations</a> in particular.
        Although we use rotation matrices in our <code>RigidTransform</code>
        class, in order to make the spatial algebra efficient, we actually use
        unit quaternions in the configuration vector $q,$ and in the
        <code>Context</code> in order to have a compact representation.</p>

        <p>As a result, for this example, the software implementation of the
        function $f_{kin}^B$ is precisely the function that converts the
        position $\times$ unit quaternion representation into the pose
        (position $\times$ rotation matrix) representation.</p>

  <section id="jacobian"><h1>Differential kinematics (Jacobians)</h1>

    <p>The forward kinematics machinery gives us the ability to compute the pose
    of the gripper and the pose of the object, both in the world frame.  But
    if our goal is to <i>move</i> the gripper to the object, then we should
    understand how changes in the joint angles relate to changes in the gripper
    pose.  This is traditionally referred to as "differential kinematics".</p>

    <p>At first blush, this is straightforward.  The change in pose is related
    to a change in joint positions by the (partial) derivative of the forward
    kinematics:  \begin{equation}dX^B = \pd{f_{kin}^B(q)}{q} dq = J^B(q)dq.
    \label{eq:jacobian}\end{equation} Partial derivatives of a function are
    referred to as "Jacobians" in many fields; in robotics it's rare to refer to
    derivatives of the kinematics as anything else.</p>

    <div>All of the subtlety, again, comes in because of the multiple
    representations that we have for 3D rotations (rotation matrix, unit
    quaternions, ...).  While there is no one best representation for 3D
    rotations, it <i>is</i> possible to have one canonical representation for
    <i>differential</i> rotations.  Without any concern for singularities nor
    loss of generality, we can represent the rate of change in pose using a
    six-component vector for <a
    href="https://drake.mit.edu/doxygen_cxx/group__multibody__spatial__vectors.html"><i>spatial
    velocity</i></a>: \begin{equation}{}^AV^B_C = \begin{bmatrix}
    {}^A\omega^B_C \\ {}^A\text{v}^B_C \end{bmatrix}.\end{equation} ${}^AV^B_C$
    is the spatial velocity (also known as a "twist") of frame $B$ measured in
    frame $A$ expressed in frame $C$, ${}^A\omega^B_C \in \Re^3$ is the
    <i>angular velocity</i> (of frame $B$ measured in $A$ expressed in frame
    $C$), and ${}^A\text{v}^B_C \in \Re^3$ is the <i>translational velocity</i>
    (along with the same shorthands as for positions).  The angular velocity is a 3D
    vector (with $w_x$, $w_y$, $w_z$ components); the magnitude of this vector
    represents the angular speed and the direction represents the (instantaneous) axis
    of rotation. It's tempting to think of it as the time derivatives of roll, pitch,
    and yaw, but that's not true; it can easily be converted to (or from) that
    representation through a <a

    map</a>. It is also not the time-derivative of the axis-angle representation; that

      <li>Angular velocities add when they are expressed in the same frame:

    <p>Why is it that we can get away with just three components for angular
    velocity, but not for rotations?  Using the magnitude of an axis-angle
    representation to denote an angle is degenerate because our representation
    of angles should be periodic in $2\pi$, but using the magnitude of the
    angular velocity is ok because angular velocities take values from
    $(-\infty, \infty)$ without wrapping.</p>

    <p>There is one more velocity to be aware of: I'll use $v$ to denote the
    generalized velocity vector of the plant, which is closely related to the
    time-derivative of $q$ (see below).  While a spatial velocity $^AV^B$ is
    six components, a translational or angular velocity, $^B\text{v}^C$ or
    $^B\omega^C$, is three components, the generalized velocity vector is
    whatever size it needs to be to encode the time derivatives of the
    configuration variables, $q$.  For the iiwa welded to the world frame, that
    means it has seven components.  I've tried to be careful to typeset each of
    these v's differently throughout the notes. Almost always the distinction
    is also clear from the context.</p>

    <example id="qdot_vs_v"><h1>Don't assume $\dot{q} \equiv v$</h1>
    
      <p>The unit quaternion representation is four components, but these must
      form a "unit vector" of length 1.  Rotation matrices are 9 components,
      but they must form an orthonormal matrix with $\det(R)=1$.  It's pretty
      great that for the time derivative of rotation, we can use an
      <i>unconstrained</i> three component vector, what we've called the
      angular velocity vector, $\omega$.  And you really should use it; getting
      rid of that constraint makes both the math and the numerics better.</p>

      <p>But there is one minor nuisance that this causes.  We tend to want to
      think of the generalized velocity as the time derivative of the
      generalized positions.  This works when we have only our iiwa in the
      model, and it is welded to the world frame, because all of the joints are
      revolute joints with a single degree of freedom each.  But we cannot
      assume this in general; when floating-base rotations are part of the
      generalized position. As evidence, here is a simple example that loads
      exactly one rigid body into the
      <code>MultibodyPlant</code>, and then prints its
      <code>Context</code>.</p>

      <script>document.write(notebook_link('pick', notebook="qdot_vs_v"))</script>

      <p>The output looks like this:
      <code><pre>Context

      <p>You can see that this system has 13 total state variables.  7 of them
      are positions, $q$, because we use unit quaternions in the position
      vector.  But we have just 6 velocities, $v$; we use angular velocities in
      the velocity vector.  Clearly, if the length of the vectors don't even
      match, we do <i>not</i> have $\dot{q} = v$.</p>

      <p>It is not difficult to deal with this representational detail; Drake
      provides the <code>MultibodyPlant</code> methods
      <code>MapQDotToVelocity</code> and <code>MapVelocityToQDot</code> to go
      back and forth between them.  But you have to remember to use them!</p>

    </example>

    <p>Due to the multiple possible representations of 3D rotation, and the
    potential difference between $\dot{q}$ and $v$, there are actually
    <b>many</b> different kinematic Jacobians possible.  You may hear the terms
    "analytic Jacobian", which refers to the explicit partial derivative of the
    forward kinematics (as written in \eqref{eq:jacobian}), and "geometric
    Jacobian" which replaces 3D rotations on the left-hand side with spatial
    velocities.  In Drake's <code>MultibodyPlant</code>, we currently offer the
    geometric Jacobian versions via
    <ul>
      <li> <code>CalcJacobianAngularVelocity</code>,</li>
      <li><code>CalcJacobianTranslationalVelocity</code>, and</li>
      <li><code>CalcJacobianSpatialVelocity</code>,</li>
    </ul> with each taking an argument to specify whether you'd like the
    Jacobian with respect to $\dot{q}$ or $v$. If you really like the
    analytical Jacobian, you could get it (much less efficiently) using Drake's
    support for automatic differentiation.</p>

  <section><h1>Differential inverse kinematics</h1>
    
    <p>The geometric Jacobian provides a linear relationship between
    generalized velocity and spatial velocity: \begin{equation}V^G =
    J^G(q)v.\end{equation} Can this give us what we need to produce changes in
    gripper frame $G$? If I have a desired gripper frame velocity $V^{G_d}$,
    then how about commanding a joint velocity $v = \left[J^G(q)\right]^{-1}
    V^{G_d}$?</p>

    <subsection><h1>The Jacobian pseudo-inverse</h1>

      <p>Any time you write a matrix inverse, it's important to check that the
      matrix is actually invertible.  As a first sanity check: what are the
      dimensions of $J^G(q)$?  We know the spatial velocity has six components.
      Our gripper frame is welded directly on the last link of the iiwa, and
      the iiwa has seven positions, so we have $J^G(q_{iiwa}) \in \Re^{6 \times
      7}.$  The matrix is not square, so does not have an inverse.  But having
      <i>more</i> degrees of freedom than the desired spatial velocity requires
      (more columns than rows) is actually the good case, in the sense that we
      might have many solutions for $v$ that can achieve a desired spatial
      velocity. To choose one of them (the minimum-norm solution), we can
      consider using the <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%E2%80%93Penrose_inverse">Moore-Penrose
      pseudo-inverse</a>, $J^+$, instead: \begin{equation}v =
      [J^G(q)]^+V^{G_d}.\end{equation}</p>

      <p>The pseudo-inverse is a beautiful mathematical concept.  When the $J$
      is square and full-rank, the pseudo-inverse returns the true inverse of
      the system. When there are many solutions (here many joint velocities that
      accomplish the same end-effector spatial velocity), then it returns the
      minimum-norm solution (the joint velocities that produce the desired
      spatial velocity which are closest to zero in the least-squares sense).
      When there is no exact solution, it returns the joint velocities that
      produce a spatial velocity which is as close to the desired end-effector
      velocity as possible, again in the least-squares sense.  So good!</p>

      <example><h1>Our first end-effector "controller"</h1>
      
        <p>Let's write a simple controller using the pseudo-inverse of the
        Jacobian.  First, we'll write a new <code>LeafSystem</code> that defines
        one input port (for the iiwa measured position), and one output port
        (for the iiwa joint velocity command).  Inside that system, we'll ask
        MultibodyPlant for the gripper Jacobian, and compute the joint
        velocities that will implement a desired gripper spatial velocity.</p>

        <div>
          <script type="text/javascript">
          var pinv = { "name": "PseudoInverseController", 
            "input_ports" : ["iiwa_position"],
            "output_ports" : ["iiwa_velocity_command"]
            };
          document.write(system_html(pinv));
          </script>
        </div>

        <p>To keep things simple for this first example, we'll just command a
        constant gripper spatial velocity, and only run the simulation for a few
        seconds.</p>

        <p>Note that we do have to add one additional system into the diagram.
        The output of our controller is a desired joint velocity, but the input
        that the iiwa controller is expecting is a desired joint position.  So
        we will insert an integrator in between.</p>

        <p>I don't expect you to understand every line in this example, but it's
        worth finding the important lines and making sure you can change them
        and see what happens!</p>

    <subsection><h1>Invertibility of the Jacobian</h1>

      <p>There is a simple check to understand when the pseudo-inverse can give
      an exact solution for any spatial velocity (achieving exactly the desired
      spatial velocity): the <i>rank</i> of the Jacobian must be equal to the
      number of rows (sometimes called "full row rank").  In this case, we need
      $\rank(J) = 6$. But assigning an integer rank to a matrix doesn't tell
      the entire story; for a real robot with (noisy) floating-point joint
      positions, as the matrix gets <i>close</i> to losing rank, the
      (pseudo-)inverse starts to "blow-up".  A better metric, then, is to watch
      the smallest <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_value_decomposition">singular
      value</a>; as this approaches zero, the norm of the pseudo-inverse will
      approach infinity.</p>

      <example><h1>Invertibility of the gripper Jacobian</h1>
      
        <p>You might have noticed that I printed out the smallest singular value
        of $J^G$ in one of the previous examples.  Take it for another spin.
        See if you can find configurations where the smallest singular value
        gets close to zero.</p>

        <script>document.write(notebook_link('pick', notebook="jacobian"))</script>

        <p>Here's a hint: try some configurations where the arm is very
        straight, (e.g. driving joint 2 and 4 close to zero).</p>

        <p>Another good way to find the singularities are to use your
        pseudo-inverse controller to send gripper spatial velocity commands
        that drive the gripper to the limits of the robot's workspace.  Try it
        and see!  In fact, this can happen easily in practice when using
        end-effector commands, and we will work hard to avoid it.</p>

      </example>

      <p>Configurations $q$ for which $\rank(J(q_{iiwa})) < 6$ for a frame of
      interest (like our gripper frame $G$) are called <i>kinematic
      singularities</i>.  Try to avoid going near them if you are using
      end-effector control!  The iiwa has many virtues, but admittedly its
      kinematic workspace is not one of them. Trust me, if you try to get a big
      Kuka to reach into a little kitchen sink all day, every day, then you
      will spend a non-trivial amount of time thinking about avoiding
      singularities.</p>

      <p>In practice, things can get a lot better if we stop bolting our robot
      base to a fixed location in the world.  Mobile bases add complexity, but
      they are wonderful for improving the kinematic workspace of a robot.</p>

      <example id="singularities"><h1>Are kinematic singularities real?</h1>

        <p>A natural question when discussing singularities is whether they are
        somehow real, or whether they are somehow an artifact of the analysis.
        Does the robot blow up? Does it get mechanically stuck? Or is it just
        our math that is broken? Perhaps it is useful to look at an extremely
        simple case.</p>

        <p>Imagine a two-link arm, where each link has length one.  Then the
        kinematics reduce to $$p^G = \begin{bmatrix} c_0 + c_{0+1} \\ s_0 +
        s_{0 + 1} \end{bmatrix},$$  where I've used the (very common) shorthard
        $s_0$ for $\sin(q_0)$, $c_0$ for $\cos(q_0)$, $s_{0+1}$ for
        $\sin(q_0+q_1),$ etc. The
        <i>translational</i> Jacobian is $$J^G(q) = \begin{bmatrix} -s_0 -
        s_{0+1} & -s_{0 + 1} \\ c_0 + c_{0 + 1} & c_{0 + 1} \end{bmatrix},$$
        and as expected, it loses rank when the arm is at full extension (e.g.
        when $q_0 = q_1 = 0$ which implies the first row is zero).</p>

        <p>Let's move the robot along the $x$-axis, by taking $q_0(t) = 1-t,$
        and $q_1(t) = -2 + 2t$.  This clearly visits the singularity $q_0 = q_1
        = 0$ at time 1, and then leaves again without trouble.  In fact, it does
        all this with a <i>constant</i> joint velocity ($\dot{q}_0=-1,
        \dot{q}_1=2$)!  The resulting trajectory is $$p^G(t) = \begin{bmatrix}
        2\cos(1-t) \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}.$$</p>

        <p>There are a few things to understand.  At the singularity, there is
        nothing that the robot can do to move its gripper farther in positive
        $x$ -- that singularity is real.  But it is also true that there is no
        way for the robot to move instantaneously back in the direction of
        $-x.$ The Jacobian analysis is not an approximation, it is a perfect
        description of the relationship between joint velocities and gripper
        velocities.  However, just because you cannot achieve an instantaneous
        velocity in the backwards direction, it does not mean you cannot get
        there!  At $t=1$, even though the joint velocities are constant, and
        the translational Jacobian is singular, the robot is
        <i>accelerating</i> in $-x$, $\ddot{p}^G_{W_x}(t) = -2\cos(1-t).$</p>

        <todo>Update this to use the two-link iiwa (like i've done in the
        qp_diff_ik notebook).  The link lengths aren't *quite* one to one, but
        it's close.  could have a point on the second link that is the right
        distance away, or just add the ratio logic here.</todo>

      </example>

      <p>For the cases when the Jacobian does not have a unique inverse, there
      is an interesting subtlety to be aware of regarding <i>integrability</i>.
      Let's start our robot in at time zero in a joint configuration, $q(0)$
      with a corresponding in an end-effector pose $X^G(0)$. Now let us execute
      an end-effector trajectory using the pseudo-inverse controller that moves
      along a closed-path in the task space, coming back to the original
      end-effector pose at time one: $X^G(1) = X^G(0)$. Unfortunately, there is
      no guarantee that $q(1) = q(0)$; this is not simply due to numerical
      errors in our numerical implementation, it is well known that the
      pseudo-inverse does not in general produce an integrable function.
      <elib>Mussa-Ivaldi91</elib> discusses this thoroughly, and proposed a
      weighted pseudo-inverse that can restore the integrability conditions by
      means of a virtual "compliance function".</p>

  <section><h1>Defining the grasp and pre-grasp poses</h1>
  
    <p>I'm going to put my red foam brick on the table.  Its geometry is <a
    href="https://github.com/RobotLocomotion/models/blob/master/manipulation_station/061_foam_brick.sdf#L21">defined</a>
    as a 7.5cm x 5cm x 5cm box.  For reference, the distance between the fingers
    on our gripper in the default "open" position is 10.7cm.  The "palm" of the
    gripper is 3.625cm from the body origin, and the fingers are 8.2cm long.</p>
    
    <p>To make things easy to start, I'll promise to set the object down on the
    table with the object frame's $z$-axis pointing up (aligned with the world
    $z$ axis), and you can assume it is resting on the table safely within the
    workspace of the robot.  But I reserve the right to give the object
    arbitrary initial yaw.  Don't worry, you might have noticed that the
    seventh joint of the iiwa will let you rotate your gripper around quite
    nicely (well beyond what my human wrist can do).</p>
    
    <p>Observe that visually the box has rotational symmetry -- I could always
    rotate the box 90 degrees around its $x$-axis and you wouldn't be able to
    tell the difference.  We'll think about the consequences of that more in the
    next chapter when we start using perception.  But for now, we are ok using
    the omniscient "cheat port" from the simulator which gives us the
    unambiguous pose of the brick.</p>

    <figure id="grasp_frames">
      <img style="width:40%" src="data/grasp_frames.png"/>
      <figcaption>The gripper frame and the object frame.  For each frame, the
      <span style="color:red">positive $x$ axis is in red</span>, the <span
      style="color:green">positive $y$ axis is in green</span>, and the <span
      style="color:blue">positive $z$ axis is in blue</span> (XYZ $\Leftrightarrow$
      RGB).</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>Take a careful look at the gripper frame in the figure above, using the colors to
    understand the axes.  Here is my thinking:  Given the size of the hand and the
    object, I want the <i>desired</i> position (in meters) of the object in the gripper
    frame, $${}^{G_{grasp}}p^O = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0.11 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}, \qquad
    {}^{G_{pregrasp}}p^O = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0.2 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}.$$  Recall that
    the logic behind a <i>pregrasp</i> pose is to first move to safely above the object,
    if our only gripper motion that is very close to the object is a straight
    translation from the pregrasp pose to the grasp pose and back, then it allows us to
    mostly avoid having to think about collisions (for now).  I want the orientation of
    my gripper to be set so that the positive $z$ axis of the object aligns with the
    negative $y$ axis of the gripper frame, and the positive $x$ axis of the object
    aligns with the positive $z$ axis of the gripper.  We can accomplish that with
    \begin{gather*}{}^{G_{grasp}}R^O = \text{MakeXRotation}\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right)
    \text{MakeZRotation} \left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right).\end{gather*}  I admit I had my
    right hand in the air for that one! We can step through this (by looking at the <a
    href="#grasp_frames">figure above</a>). Put your right hand in the air in the
    standard "right-hand-rule pose" (index finger forward, middle finger to the left,
    thumb up); we'll call this frame $H$ (for hand) and we'll attach it to the object
    frame, so ${}^OR^H = I.$ We want to understand the orientation of your hand in the
    gripper frame, ${}^{G_{grasp}}R^H$. Working from right to left in the matrix
    multiplications, we first rotate 90 degrees around the current $z$ axis (your thumb)
    -- your index finger should be pointing to the left. Now we rotate 90 degrees about
    the current $x$ axis (still forward), so your index finger is pointing up, your
    middle finger is point towards you, and your thumb is pointing to the right. As
    desired, the positive $z$ axis (your thumb) aligns with the negative $y$ axis, and
    the positive $x$ axis (your index finger) aligns with the positive $z$ axis of the
    gripper frame.</p>
        
    <p>Our pregrasp pose will have the same orientation as our grasp pose.</p>

      <figure>
        <img style="width:70%" src="figures/grasp_pose.png"/>
      </figure>
  
      <p>Here is a simple example of loading a floating Schunk gripper and a
      brick, computing the grasp / pregrasp pose (drawing out each
      transformation clearly), and rendering the hand relative to the
      object.</p>

      <script>document.write(notebook_link('pick', notebook="grasp"))</script>

      <p>I hope you can see the value of having good notation at work here.  My
      right hand was in the air when I was deciding what a suitable relative
      pose for the object in the hand should be (when writing the notes).  But
      once that was decided, I went to type it in and everything just
      worked.</p>

  <section id="pick_and_place_trajectory"><h1>A pick and place trajectory</h1>
  
    <p>We're getting close.  We know how to produce desired gripper poses, and
    we know how to change the gripper pose instantaneously using spatial
    velocity commands. Now we need to specify how we want the gripper poses to
    change over time, so that we can convert our gripper poses into spatial
    velocity commands.</p>

    <p>Let's define all of the "keyframe" poses that we'd like the gripper to
    travel through, and time that it should visit each one.  The following
    example does precisely that.</p>

    <example><h1>A plan "sketch"</h1>

      <script>document.write(notebook_link('pick'))</script>

      <figure>
        <img style="width:70%" src="figures/pick_sketch.png"/>
        <figcaption>Keyframes of the gripper.  The robot's base will be at the
        origin, so we're looking over the (invisible) robot's shoulder here. The
        hand starts in the "initial" pose near the center, moves to the
        "prepick" to "pick" to "postpick" to "clearance" to "preplace" to "place"
        and finally back to "postplace".</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <todo>timeline graphic here, from time zero, to pre-grasp, to grasp, to
      </todo>

      <p>How did I choose the times?  I started everything at time, $t=0$, and
      listed the rest of our times as absolute (time from zero). That's when the
      robot wakes up and sees the brick.  How long should we take to transition
      from the starting pose to the pregrasp pose?  A really good answer might
      depend on the exact joint speed limits of the robot, but we're not trying
      to move fast yet.  Instead I chose a conservative time that is
      proportional to the total Euclidean distance that the hand will travel,
      say $k=10~s/m$ (aka $10~cm/s$): $$t_{pregrasp} = k
      \left\|{}^{G_0}p^{G_{pregrasp}}\right\|_2.$$  I just chose a fixed
      duration of 2 seconds for the transitions from pregrasp to grasp and back,
      and also left 2 seconds with the gripper stationary for the segments where
      the fingers needs to open/close.</p>
  
    </example>

    <p>There are a number of ways one might represent a trajectory
    computationally. We have a pretty good collection of
    <a
    href="https://drake.mit.edu/doxygen_cxx/namespacedrake_1_1trajectories.html">trajectory</a>
    classes available in Drake.  Many of them are implemented as <a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spline_(mathematics)">splines</a> --
    piecewise polynomial functions of time.  Interpolating between orientations
    requires some care, but for positions we can do a simple linear
    interpolation between each of our keyframes.  That would be called a "<a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-order_hold">first-order hold</a>",
    and it's implemented in Drake's <a
    href="https://drake.mit.edu/doxygen_cxx/classdrake_1_1trajectories_1_1_piecewise_polynomial.html">PiecewisePolynomial</a>
    class.  For rotations, we'll use something called "spherical linear
    interpolation" or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slerp">slerp</a>,
    which is implemented in Drake's <a
    href="https://drake.mit.edu/doxygen_cxx/classdrake_1_1trajectories_1_1_piecewise_quaternion_slerp.html">PiecewiseQuaternionSlerp</a>, and which you can explore in <a href="#slerp">this exercise</a>.  The <a href="https://drake.mit.edu/doxygen_cxx/classdrake_1_1trajectories_1_1_piecewise_pose.html">PiecewisePose</a> class makes it convenient to construct and work with the position and orientation trajectories together.</p>

    <example><h1>Grasping with trajectories</h1>
    
      <p>There are a number of ways to visualize the trajectory when it's
      connected to 3D.  I've plotted the <i>position</i> trajectory as a
      function of time below.<p>  

      <script>document.write(notebook_link('pick'))</script>

      <figure>
        <img width="60%" src="data/gripper_position_trajectory.svg"/>

        height=400 width="100%" src="data/gripper_position_trajectory.html"/> -->
      </figure>

      <p></p>With 3D data, you can <a
      href="data/gripper_position_trajectory.html">plot it in 3D</a>.  But my
      favorite approach is as <a href="data/gripper_trajectory.html">an
      animation in our 3D renderer</a>!  Make sure you try the "Open
      controls>Animation" interface.  You can pause it and then scrub through
      the trajectory using the time slider.</p>

      <p>For a super interesting discussion on how we might visualize the 4D
      quaternions as creatures trapped in 3D, you might enjoy <a
      href="https://eater.net/quaternions">this series of "explorable"
      videos</a>.</p>
    </example>

    <p>One final detail -- we also need a trajectory of gripper commands (to
    open and close the gripper).  We'll use a first-order hold for that, as
    well.</p>

  </section>

  <section><h1>Putting it all together</h1>
  
    <p>We can slightly generalize our PseudoInverseController to have
    additional input ports for the desired gripper spatial velocity, ${}^WV^G$
    (in our first version, this was just hard-coded in the controller).</p>

    <div>
      <script type="text/javascript">
      var pinv = { "name": "PseudoInverseController", 
        "input_ports" : ["V_WG", "iiwa_position"],
        "output_ports" : ["iiwa_velocity_command"]
        };
      document.write(system_html(pinv));
      </script>
    </div>

    <p>The trajectory we have constructed is a <i>pose</i> trajectory, but our
    controller needs spatial velocity commands. Fortunately, the trajectory
    classes we have used support differentiating the trajectories.  In fact,
    the <code>PiecewiseQuaternionSlerp</code> is clever enough to return the
    derivative of the 4-component quaternion trajectory as a 3-component
    angular velocity trajectory, and taking the derivative of a
    <code>PiecewisePose</code> trajectory returns a spatial velocity
    trajectory.  The rest is just a matter of wiring up the system diagram.</p>

    <example><h1>The full pick and place demo</h1>
    
      <p>The next few cells of the notebook should get you a pretty satisfying
      result.  <a href="data/pick.html">Click here to watch it without doing the

      <p>It's worth scrutinizing the result.  For instance, if you examine the
      context at the final time, how close did it come to the desired final
      gripper position?  Are you happy with the joint positions?  If you ran
      that same trajectory in reverse, then back and forth (as an industrial
      robot might), would you expect errors to accumulate?</p>

    </example>

  </section>

  <section id="diff_ik_w_constraints"><h1>Differential inverse kinematics with
  constraints</h1>

    <p>Our solution above works in many cases.  We could potentially move on.
    But with just a little more work, we can get a much more robust solution...
    one that we will be happy with for many chapters to come.</p>

    <p>So what's wrong with the pseudo-inverse controller?  You won't be
    surprised when I say that it does not perform well around singularities.
    When the minimum singular value of the Jacobian gets small, that means that
    some values in the inverse get very large.  If you ask our controller to
    track a seemingly reasonable end-effector spatial velocity, then you might
    have extremely large velocity commands as a result.</p>

    <p>There are other important limitations, though, which are perhaps more
    subtle. The real robot has constraints, very real constraints on the joint
    angles, velocities, accelerations, and torques.  If you, for instance, send
    a velocity command to the iiwa controller that cannot be followed, that
    velocity will be clipped.  In the mode we are running the iiwa
    (joint-impedance mode), the iiwa doesn't know anything about your
    end-effector goals.  So it will very likely simply saturate your velocity
    commands independently joint by joint.  The result, I'm afraid, will not be
    as convenient as a slower end-effector trajectory.  Your end-effector could
    run wildly off course.</p>

    <p>Since we know the limits of the iiwa, a better approach is to take these
    constraints into account at the level of our controller.  It's relatively
    straight-forward to take position, velocity, and acceleration constraints
    into account; torque constraints require a full dynamics model so we won't
    worry about them yet here (but they <i>can</i> plug in naturally to this
    framework).</p>

    <subsection><h1>Pseudo-inverse as an optimization</h1>

      <p>I introduced the pseudo-inverse as having almost magical properties:
      it returns an exact solution when one is available, or the best possible
      solution (in the least-squares norm) when one is not.  These properties
      can all be understood by realizing that the pseudo-inverse is just the
      optimal solution to a least-squares optimization problem:
      \begin{equation} \min_v \left|J^G(q)v - V^{G_d}\right|^2_2.
      \end{equation}  When I write an optimization of this form, I will refer
      to $v$ as the decision variable(s), and I will use $v^*$ to denote the
      optimal solution (the value of the decision variables that minimizes the
      cost).  This particular optimization problem has a closed-form solution,
      which just happens to be exactly what is provided by the pseudo-inverse:
      $$v^* = \left[ J^G(q) \right]^+V^{G_d}.$$ More generally, we will expect
      to employ numerical methods to solve optimization problems.</p>

      <p>Optimization is an incredibly rich topic, and we will put many tools
      from optimization to use over the course of this text.  For a beautiful
      rigorous but accessible treatment of convex optimization, I highly
      recommend <elib>Boyd04a</elib>; it is free online and even reading the
      first chapter can be incredibly valuable.  For a very short introduction
      to using optimization in Drake, please take a look at the
      <script>document.write(drake_tutorials_link(
        'mathematical_program',
        link_text='tutorials on MathematicalProgram'))</script>.
      I use the term "mathematical program" almost synonymously with
      "optimization problem".  Mathematical program is perhaps slightly more
      appropriate if we don't actually have an objective; only constraints.</p>
    
    </subsection>

    <subsection><h1>Adding velocity constraints</h1>
    
      <p>Once we understand our existing solution through the lens of
      optimization, we have a natural route to generalizing our approach to
      explicitly reason about the constraints.  The velocity constraints are the
      most straight-forward to add.  \begin{align} \min_v && \left|J^G(q)v -
      V^{G_d}\right|^2_2\,, \\ \subjto && v_{min} \le v \le v_{max}. \nonumber
      \end{align}  You can read this as "find me the joint velocities that
      achieve my desired gripper spatial velocity as closely as possible, but
      satisfy my joint velocity constraints."  The solution to this can be much
      better than what you would get from solving the unconstrained optimization
      and then simply trimming any velocities to respect the constraints after
      the fact.</p>

      <p>This is, admittedly, a harder problem to solve in general.  The
      solution cannot be described using only the pseudo-inverse of the
      Jacobian.  Rather, we are going to solve this (small) optimization problem
      directly in our controller every time it is evaluated.  This problem has a
      convex quadratic objective and linear constraints, so it falls into the
      class of convex Quadratic Programming (QP).  This is a particularly nice
      class of optimization problems where we have very strong numerical
      tools.</p>

      <example><h1>Jacobian-based control with velocity constraints</h1>
      
        <p>To help think about the differential inverse kinematics problem as
        an optimization, I've put together a visualization of the optimization
        landscape of the quadratic program.  In the notebook below, you will
        see the constraints visualized as in red, and the objective function
        visualized as a function in green.</p>

        <script>document.write(notebook_link('pick', notebook="qp_diff_ik"))</script>

      </example>
    
    </subsection>

    <subsection><h1>Adding position and acceleration constraints</h1>

      <p>We can easily add more constraints to our QP, without significantly
      increasing the complexity, as long as they are linear in the decision
      variables.  So how should we add constraints on the joint position and
      acceleration?</p>        

      <p>The natural approach is to make a first-order approximation of these
      constraints.  To do that, the controller needs some characteristic time step / timescale to relate its velocity decisions to positions and accelerations.  We'll denote that time step as $h$.</p>
      
      <p>The controller already accepts the current measured joint positions $q$
      as an input; let us now also take the current measured joint velocities
      $v$ as a second input.  And we'll use $v_n$ for our decision variable --
      the next velocity to command.  Using a simple <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_method">Euler approximation</a>
      of position and first-order derivative for acceleration gives us the
      following optimization problem: \begin{align} \min_{v_n} \quad &
      \left|J^G(q)v_n - V^{G_d}\right|^2_2, \\ \subjto \quad & v_{min} \le v_n
      \le v_{max}, \nonumber \\ & q_{min} \le q + h v_n \le q_{max}, \nonumber
      \\ & \dot{v}_{min} \le \frac{v_n - v}{h} \le \dot{v}_{max}. \nonumber
      \end{align}</p>

    </subsection>

    <subsection id="joint_centering"><h1>Joint centering</h1>
  
      <p>Our Jacobian is $6 \times 7$, so we actually have more degrees of
      freedom than end-effector goals. This is not only an opportunity, but a
      responsibility. When the rank of $J^G$ is less than the number of columns
      / number of degrees of freedom, then we have specified an optimization
      problem that has an infinite number of solutions; and we've left it up to
      the solver to choose one. Typically a convex optimization solver does
      choose something reasonable, like taking the "analytic center" of the
      constraints, or a minimum-norm solution for an unconstrained problem. But
      why leave this to chance? It's much better for us to completely specify
      the problem so that there is a unique global optima.</p>

      <p>In the rich history of Jacobian-based control for robotics, there is a
      very elegant idea of implementing a "secondary" control, guaranteed (in
      some cases) not to interfere with our primary end-effector spatial
      velocity controller, by projecting it into the <i>null space</i> of $J^G$.
      So in order to fully specify the problem, we will provide a secondary
      controller that attempts to control <i>all</i> of the joints.  We'll do
      that here with a simple joint-space controller $v = K(q_0 - q)$; this is
      a proportional controller that drives the robot to its nominal
      configuration.</p>
      
      <p>Denote $P(q)$ as a linear map from the generalized velocities into the
      nullspace of $J(q)$. Traditionally in robotics we implemented this using the
      pseudo-inverse: $P = (I - J^+J)$, but many linear algebra packages now provide
      methods to obtain an orthonormal basis for the kernel of a Jacobian $J$ directly.
      Adding $Pv \approx PK(q_0 - q)$ as a secondary objective can be accomplished with
      \begin{align}\min_{v_n} \quad & \left|J^G(q)v_n - V^{G_d}\right|^2_2 + \epsilon
      \left|P(q)\left(v_n - K(q_0 - q)\right)\right|^2_2, \\ \subjto \quad &
      \text{constraints}.\nonumber\end{align} Note the scalar $\epsilon$ that we've
      placed in front of the secondary objective.  There is something important to
      understand here.  If we do not have any constraints, then we can remove $\epsilon$
      completely -- the secondary task will in no way interfere with the primary task of
      tracking the spatial velocity. However, if there are constraints, then these
      constraints can cause the two objectives to clash (<a
      href="#competing_objectives">Exercise</a>).  So we pick $\epsilon \ll 1$ to give
      the primary objective relatively more weight.  But don't make it too small,
      because that might make the numerics bad for your solver.  I'd say $\epsilon ~=
      0.01$ is just about right.</p>

      <p>There are more sophisticated methods if one wishes to establish a
      strict task prioritization in the presence of constraints (e.g.
      <elib>Flacco15+Escande14</elib>), but for the simple prioritization we
      have formulated here, the penalty method is quite reasonable.</p>

      <p>Sometimes it can be more natural to specify the goal for differential IK as
      tracking a desired pose, ${}^AX^{G_d}$, rather than explicitly specifying the
      desired spatial velocity. But we can naturally convert the pose command into a
      spatial velocity command, ${}^AV^{G_d}_A.$ The translational component is simple
      enough, we'll use $${}^Ap^{G_d}_A = {}^Ap^G_A + h {}^Av^{G}_A \quad \Rightarrow
      \quad {}^A\text{v}^{G}_A  = \frac{1}{h} \left({}^Ap^{G_d}_A - {}^Ap^G_A\right) =
      \frac{1}{h}{}^Gp^{G_d}_A.$$ Similarly, for the angular velocity, we will choose
      $${}^A\omega^{G}_A = \frac{1}{h} {}^GR^{G_d},$$ where ${}^GR^{G_d}$ is represented
      in <a href="#axis-angle">axis-angle</a> form.</p>
    
    </subsection>

    <subsection><h1>Alternative formulations</h1>
    
      <p>Once we have embraced the idea of solving a small optimization problem
      in our control loop, many other formulations are possible, too.  You will
      find many in the literature.  Minimizing the least-squares distance
      between the commanded spatial velocity and the resulting velocity might
      not actually be the best solution.  The formulation we have been using
      heavily in Drake adds an additional constraint that our solution
      <b>must</b> move in the same <i>direction</i> as the commanded spatial
      velocity.  If we are up against constraints, then we may slow down, but we
      will not deviate (instantaneously) from the commanded path.  It would be a
      pity to spend a long time carefully planning collision-free paths for your
      end-effector, only to have your controller treat the path as merely a
      suggestion.  Note, however, that your plan playback system still needs to be smart enough to realize that the slow-down occurred (open-loop velocity commands are not enough).</p>

      <p>\begin{align} \max_{v_n, \alpha} \quad & \alpha, \\ \subjto \quad &
      J^G(q)v_n = \alpha V^{G_d}, \nonumber \\ & 0 \le \alpha \le 1, \nonumber
      \\ & \text{additional constraints}. \nonumber \end{align}  You should
      immediately ask yourself: is it reasonable to scale a spatial velocity by
      a scalar?  That's another great <a
      href="#scaling_spatial_velocity">exercise</a>. </p>

      <p>What happens in this formulation when the Jacobian drops row rank?
      Observe that $v_n = 0, \alpha = 0$ is always a feasible solution for this
      problem.  So if it's not possible to move in the commanded direction,
      then the robot will just stop.</p>

      <p id="rpy_diffik">For teleop with human operators, coming to a complete stop when
      one cannot move in exactly the commanded direction can be too restrictive -- the
      operator feels like the robot gets "stuck" every time that the robot approaches a
      constraint. For instance, imagine if we have a collision avoidance constraint
      between the robot gripper and a table, and the operator wants to move the hand
      along the table top. This would be effectively impossible given the strict
      formulation. We have found that the following relaxation is more intuitive for the
      operator:
      <p>\begin{align} \max_{v_n, \alpha} \quad & \sum_i \alpha_i, \\ \subjto \quad &
      J^G(q)v_n = E(q) \text{diag}(\alpha) E^{-1}(q) V^{G_d}, \nonumber \\ & 0 \le
      \alpha_i \le 1, \nonumber \\ & \text{additional constraints}. \nonumber
      \end{align} Here $E(q)$ is the <a
      href="https://github.com/RobotLocomotion/drake/blob/d1a1d14b323c8a4a481a8d11fc8e9c527d63bf20/multibody/tree/rpy_ball_mobilizer.cc#L223">linear
      map</a> from the derivative of the Euler angle representation (e.g.
      $\frac{d}{dt}[roll, pitch, yaw, x, y, z]$) to the spatial velocity. Note that we
      can avoid the $E^{-1}(q)$, which can become singular, by accepting the spatial
      velocity command using the Euler angle derivatives. To someone familiar with
      optimization, this looks a bit strange -- the diagonal matrix is a
      <i>coordinate-dependent</i>
      scaling of the velocity. But that is exactly the point -- for human operators is
      it more intuitive to saturate the velocity commands component-wise in the
      coordinates of x, y, z, roll, pitch, and yaw, typically specified in the robot's
      base frame. When you're trying to slide the robot end-effector along the table
      top, the velocity component going into the table will saturate, but the components
      orthogonal the table need not saturate. Importantly, you won't ever see the
      end-effector twist when you are commanding pure translation, and won't see the
      end-effector translate when you are commanding a pure rotation.</p>

  <exercise id="slerp"><h1>Spherical linear interpolation (slerp)</h1>
    <p>For positions, we can linearly interpolate between points, i.e. a
    "first-order hold". When dealing with rotations, we cannot simply linearly
    interpolate and must instead use spherical linear interpolation (slerp).
    The goal of this problem is to dig into the details of slerp.</p>

    <p>To do so we will consider the simpler case where our rotations are in
    $\Re^{2}$ and can be represented with complex numbers.  Here are the rules
    of the game:  a 2D vector (x,y) will be represented as a complex number $z
    = x + yi$.  To rotate this vector by $\theta$, we will multiply by
    $e^{i\theta} = \cos(\theta) + i\sin(\theta).$  </p>

    <figure>
      <img style="width:50%", src="figures/exercises/slerp.png"/>
    </figure>

    <ol type="a">
      <li> Let's verify that this works. Take the 2D vector $(x,y) = (1,1)$.
      If you convert this vector into a complex number, multiply by $z =
      e^{i\pi/4}$ using complex multiplication, and convert the result back to
      a 2D vector, do you get the expected result?  Show your work and explain
      why this is the expected result. </li>
    </ol>

    <p>Take a minute to convince yourself that this recipe (going from a 2D
    vector to a complex number, multiply by $e^{i\theta}$, and converting back
    to a 2D vector) is mathematically equivalent to multiplying the original
    number by the 2D rotation matrix: $$R(\theta) = \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & -\sin\theta
    \\ \sin\theta & \cos\theta \end{bmatrix}.$$</p>     

    <p>A frame $F$ has an orientation. We can represent that orientation using
    the rotation from the world frame, e.g. $^WR^F$. We've just verified that
    you can represent that rotation using a complex number, $e^{i\theta}$. Now
    assume we want to interpolate between two orientations, represented by
    frames $F$ and $G$. How should we smoothly interpolate between the two
    frames, e.g. using $t\in [0,1]$? You'll explore this in parts (b) and (c).
    </p>

    <ol type="a" start=2>
      <li> Attempt 1: Consider $z(t) = (a_F*(1-t) + a_G*t) + i (b_F*(1-t) +
      b_G*t)$.  Take $t=.5$.  What happens if you multiply the 2D vector
      $(1,1)$ by $z(t = .5)$? Show your work and explain what goes wrong.
      </li><br/>

      <li> Attempt 2: Instead we can leverage the other representation: $z(t) =
      e^{i \theta_{F}*(1-t) + i\theta_{G}*t}$.  What happens if we multiply by
      the 2D vector $(1,1)$ by $z(t = .5)$? Again, show your work.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Quaternions simply are a generalization of this idea to 3D. In 2D, it
    might seem inefficient to use two numbers and a constraint that $a^2 + b^2
    = 1$ to represent a single rotation (why not just $\theta$!?), but we've
    seen that it works.  In 3D we can use 4 numbers $x,y,z,w$ plus the
    constraint that $x^2+y^2+z^2+w^2 = 1$ to represent a 3D rotation.  In 2D,
    using just $\theta$ can work fine, but in 3D using only three numbers leads
    to problems like the famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gimbal_lock" target="_blank">gimbal lock</a>.
    The 4 numbers forming a unit quaternion provides a non-degenerate mapping
    of all 3D rotations.</p>

    <p>Just like we saw in 2D, one cannot simply linearly interpolate the 4
    numbers of the quaternion to interpolate orientations.  Instead, we
    linearly interpolate the angle between two orientations, using the
    quaternion slerp.  The details involve some quaternion notation, but the
    concept is the same as in 2D.</p>

  <exercise id="jacobian_exploration"><h1>Exploring the Jacobian</h1>
      <p>Exercise 3.5 asked you to derive the translational Jacobian for the
      planar two-link manipulator. In this problem we will explore the
      translational Jacobian in more detail in the context of multi-link manipulators.</p>

      <ol type="a">
          <li>For the planar two-link manipulator, the size of the planar 
          translational Jacobian is 2x2. Consider an N-link manipulator in which the 
          joint angles are $(q_{0}, q_{1}, ..., q_{N-1})$, and has an end-effector position 
          described by (x, y, z). What is the size of the translational Jacobian?</li><br/>
          <li>In considering these multi-link manipulators, we'll call the space of possible 
          joint angles the <b>configuration space</b> and the space of possible end-effector 
          positions the <b>operational space</b>.

                  <li> If the shape of translational Jacobian is structured such that the 
                  dimension of the configuration space is equal to the dimension of the 
                  operational space, when can the inverse be computed? (give more than 
                  "when the Jacobian is invertible"). If the inverse can be computed, how 
                  many sets of joint velocities can be commanded to produce a desired end-effector 
                  velocity?</li><br>
                  <li>Consider if the dimension of the configuration space is greater than the

              </ol> </li><br/>
          <li>Below, for the planar two-link manipulator, we draw the unit
          circle of joint velocities in the $\dot{q_{1}}-\dot{q_{2}}$
          plane. This circle is then mapped through the translational Jacobian
          to an ellipse in the end effector velocity space. In other words,
          this visualizes that the translational Jacobian maps the space of
          joint velocities to the space of end-effector velocities.<br/><br/>
          The ellipse in the end-effector velocity space is called the
          <i>manipulability ellipsoid</i>. The manipulability ellipsoid
          graphically captures the robot's ability to move its end effector in
          each direction. For example, the closer the ellipsoid is to a circle,
          the more easily the end effector can move in arbitrary directions.
          When the robot is at a singularity, it cannot generate end effector
          velocities in certain directions. Thinking back to the singularities
          you explored in Exercise 3.5, at one of these singularities, what
          shape would the manipulability ellipsoid collapse to?</li>

  <exercise id="competing_objectives"><h1>Competing objectives</h1>

    <p>In the section on <a href="#joint_centering">joint centering</a>, I
    claimed that an secondary objective might compete with a primary objective
    if they are linked through constraints.  To see this, consider the following
    optimization problem \begin{align*}\min_{x,y} \quad (x-5)^2 +
    (y+3)^2.\end{align*}  Clearly, the optimal solution is given by $x^*=5,
    y^*=-3$.  Moreover, the objective are separable.  The addition of the second
    objective, $(y+3)^2$, did not in any way impact the solution of the
    first.</p>
    
    <p>Now consider the constrained optimization \begin{align*}\min_{x,y} \quad&
    (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 \\ \subjto \quad& x - y \le 6. \end{align*} If the second
    objective was removed, then we would still have $x^*=5$.  What is the result
    of the optimization as written (it's only a few lines of code, if you want
    to do it that way)?  <!-- answer: 4, -2 --> I think you'll find that these
    "orthogonal" objectives actually compete!</p>

    <p>What happens if you change the problem to \begin{align*}\min_{x,y} \quad&
    (x-5)^2 + \frac{1}{100}(y+3)^2 \\ \subjto \quad& x - y \le 6? \end{align*}
    I think you'll find that solution is quite close to $x^*=5$, but also that
    $y^*$ is quite different than that $y^*=0$ one would obtain if the
    "secondary" objective was omitted completely.</p>

    <p>Note that if the constraint was not active at the optimal solution (e.g.
    $x=5, y=-3$ satisfied the constraints), then the objectives do not
    compete.</p>

    <p>This seems like an overly simple example.  But I think you'll find that
    it is actually quite similar to what is happening in the null-space objective
    formulation above.</p>

  <exercise id="representing_rotations"><h1>Challenges with Representing of Rotations in 3D</h1></exercise>
  <p>In the section on <a href="#3D_rotation">representing 3D rotations</a>, I mentioned that there is no one representation of 3D rotations that's best for everything. In this problem, you will explore some of the unexpected properties associated with a few of the most commonly used representations.</p>

  <ol type="a">
    <li><i>Roll-Pitch-Yaw:</i> One way we can represent a rotation is with a set of "roll-pitch-yaw" angles $(r,p,y)$. Refer to Drake's <a href="https://drake.mit.edu/doxygen_cxx/classdrake_1_1math_1_1_roll_pitch_yaw.html">RollPitchYaw</a> class for conventions on the ordering of these individual angle rotations into a single rotation matrix. Given that $p=-\pi/2$, compute a rotation matrix in terms of $r$ and $y$. In the resulting matrix, how does a change in $r$ compare to a change in $y$? What does this tell us about "roll-pitch-yaw" as a representation for rotations?<br /><br />
    Hint: Try simplifying your solution using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_trigonometric_identities#Angle_sum_and_difference_identities">angle sum trigonometric identities</a> $$\sin(\alpha+\beta)=\sin\alpha\cos\beta+\cos\alpha\sin\beta$$ $$\cos(\alpha+\beta)=\cos\alpha\cos\beta-\sin\alpha\sin\beta$$.</li>
    <li id="axis-angle"><i>Axis-Angle:</i> Consider an orientation obtained by rotating a right-handed coordinate frame about its z-axis by an angle of $\pi/2$ radians. This rotation would result in the positive x-axis pointing in the direction where the positive y-axis was pointing before rotation. One way to represent this rotation is with the axis-angles vector $(0,0,\pi/2)$. (Recall that the vector describes the axis about which the rotation occurs, and its magnitude is the angle of rotation). This representation is not unique. Find two other sets of axis-angles that would give the same rotation.</li>
    <li><i>Quaternion:</i> A unit quaternion is a set of four numbers $(w,x,y,z)$ such that $w^2+x^2+y^2+z^2=1$. Unit quaternions are an excellent way of representing orientations, since they don't suffer from singularities (unlike the roll-pitch-yaw and axis-angle representations). This makes them reliable for <a href="#pick_and_place_trajectory">interpolating orientations</a>, but unit quaternions still suffer from the "multiple representations" problem.<br /><br />
    We can turn a unit quaternion $(w,x,y,z)$ into an axis-angle vector $(a_x,a_y,a_z)$ by computing $\theta=2\arccos(w)$, and then for any integer $n$: $$(a_x,a_y,a_z)=\left\{\begin{array}{ll} \displaystyle\frac{\theta}{\sin(\theta/2)}(x,y,z) & \theta\ne 2n\pi\\ (0,0,0) & \theta=2n\pi \end{array}\right.$$ Show that for any unit quaternion $(w,x,y,z)$, $(-w,-x,-y,-z)$ represents the same orientation by converting to axis-angle form, and simplifying the resulting trigonometric expressions.<br /><br />
    As it turns out, there are precisely two unit quaternions corresponding to each orientation!<br /><br />
    Hint 1: $\arccos(-\alpha)=\pi-\arccos(\alpha)$ and $\sin(\pi-\beta)=\sin(\beta)$ for any $\alpha$ and $\beta$.<br />
    Hint 2: Use the fact that for any angle $\theta$, $\theta\pm 2\pi$ represents the same orientation.<br />
    Hint 3: Note that $\frac{1}{\sin(\theta/2)}(x,y,z)$ is a unit vector.</li>
