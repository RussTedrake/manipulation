<chapter style="counter-reset: chapter 9"><h1>Deep Perception for
Manipulation</h1>

  <p>In the previous chapter, we discussed deep-learning approaches to object
  detection and (instance-level) segmentation; these are general-purpose tasks
  for processing RGB images that are used broadly in computer vision. Detection
  and segmentation alone can be combined with geometric perception to, for
  instance, estimate the pose of a known object in just the segmented point
  cloud instead of the entire scene, or to run our point-cloud grasp selection
  algorithm only on the segmented point cloud in order to pick up an object of
  interest.</p>

  <p>One of the most amazing features of deep learning for perception is that
  we can pre-train on a different dataset (like ImageNet or COCO) or even a
  different task and then fine-tune on our domain-specific dataset or task. But
  what are the right perception tasks for manipulation?  Object detection and
  segmentation are a great start, but often we want to know more about the
  scene/objects to manipulate them. That is the topic of this chapter.</p>

  <p>There is a potential answer to this question that we will defer to a later
  chapter: learning end-to-end "visuomotor" policies, sometimes affectionately
  referred to as "pixels to torques". Here I want us to think first about how
  we can combine a deep-learning-based perception system with the powerful
  existing (model-based) tools that we have been building up for planning and
  control.</p>

  <todo> maybe a system diagram which includes perception, planning and
  control? So far we’ve had two version - grasp candidates and/or object pose…
  </todo>

  <p>I'll start with the deep-learning version of a perception task we've
  already considered: object pose estimation.</p>

  <!-- representations of uncertainty should be a theme i'll carry throughout.
  make analogy to object detection outputs (e.g. in mask-rcnn) -->

  <section><h1>Pose estimation</h1>

    <!-- some notes in 2021 lecture 11 ithoughts. -->

    <p>We discussed pose estimation at some length in the <a
    href="pose.html">geometric perception chapter</a>, and had a few take-away
    messages. Most importantly, the geometric approaches have only a very
    limited ability to make use of RGB values; but these are incredibly
    valuable for resolving a pose. Geometry alone doesn't tell the full story.
    Another subtle lesson was that the ICP loss, although conceptually very
    clean, does not sufficiently capture the richer concepts like
    non-penetration and free-space constraints. As the original core problems
    in 2D computer vision started to feel "solved", we've seen a surge of
    interest/activity from the computer vision community on 3D perception,
    which is great for robotics!</p>

    <p>The conceptually simplest version of this problem is that we would like
    to estimate the pose of a known object from a single RGB image. How should
    we train a mustard-bottle-specific (for example) deep network which takes
    an RGB image in, and outputs a pose estimate? Of course, if we can do this,
    we can also apply the idea to e.g. the images cropped from the bounding
    box output of an object recognition / instance segmentation system.</p> 

    <subsection><h1>Pose representation</h1>
    
      <p>Once again, we must confront the question of how best to represent a
      pose. Many initial architectures discretized the pose space into bins and
      formulated pose estimation as a classification problem, but the trend
      eventually shifted towards pose
      regression<elib>Mahendran17+Xiang17</elib>. Regressing three numbers to
      represent x-y-z translation seems clear, but we have many choices for how
      to represent 3D orientation (e.g. Euler angles, unit quaternions,
      rotation matrices, ...), and our choice can impact learning and
      generalization performance.</p>

      <p>To output a single pose, works like <elib>Zhou19</elib> and
      <elib>Levinson20</elib> argue that many rotation parameterizations have
      issues with discontinuities. They recommend having the network output 6
      numbers for the rotation (and then projecting to SO(3) via Gram-Schmidt
      orthogonalization), or outputting the full 9 numbers of the rotation
      matrix, and projecting back to SO(3) via <a
      href="pose.html#registration">SVD orthogonalization</a>.</p>
    
      <p>Perhaps more substantially, many works have pointed out that
      outputting a single "correct" pose is simply not sufficient
      <elib>Hashimoto20+Deng22</elib>. When objects have rotational symmetries,
      or if they are severely occluded, then outputting an entire pose
      distribution is much more adequate. Representing a categorial
      distribution is very natural for discretized representations, but how do
      we represent distributions over continuous pose? One very elegant choice
      is the Bingham distribution, which gives the natural generalization of
      Gaussians applied to unit quaternions
      <elib>Glover14+Peretroukhin20+Deng22</elib>. </p>

    </subsection>

    <subsection><h1>Loss functions</h1>

      <p>No matter which pose representation is coming out of the network and
      the ground truth labels, one must choose the appropriate loss function.
      Quaternion-based loss functions can be used to compute the geodesic
      distance between two orientations, and should certainly be more
      appropriate than e.g. a least-squares metric on Euler angles. More
      expensive, but potentially more suitable is to write the loss function in
      terms of a reconstruction error so that the network is not artificially
      penalized for e.g. symmetries which it could not possibly address
      <elib>Hodan20</elib>.</p>

      <p>Training a network to output an entire distribution over pose brings
      up additional interesting questions about the choice for the loss
      function. While it is possible to train the distribution based on only
      the statistics of the data labeled with ground truth pose (again,
      choosing maximum likelihood loss vs mean-squared error), it is also
      possible to use our understanding of the symmetries to provide more
      direct supervision. For example, <elib>Hashimoto20</elib> used image
      differences to efficiently (but heuristically) estimate a ground-truth
      covariance for each sample.</p>

    <subsection><h1>Limitations</h1>
    
      <p>Although pose estimation is a natural task, and it is straightforward
      to plug an estimated pose into many of our robotics pipelines, I feel
      pretty strongly that this is often not the right choice for connecting
      perception to planning and control. Although some attempts have been made
      to generalize pose to categories of objects <elib>Wang19</elib>, pose
      estimation is pretty strongly tied to known objects, which feels
      limiting. Accurately estimating the pose of an object is difficult, and
      is often not necessary for manipulation.</p>

  <section><h1>Grasp selection</h1>

    <p>In <elib>Gibson77+Gibson79</elib>, J.J. Gibson articulated his highly
    influential <i>theory of affordances</i>, where he described the role of
    perception as serving behavior (and behavior being controlled by
    perception). In our case, affordances describe not what the
    object/environment is nor its pose, but what opportunities for action it
    provides to the robot. Importantly, one can potentially estimate
    affordances without explicitly estimating pose.</p>

    <p>Two of the earliest and most successful examples of this were
    <elib>tenPas17+tenPas18</elib> and <elib>Mahler17+Mahler17a</elib>, which
    attempted to learn a grasping affordances directly from raw RGB-D input.
    <elib>tenPas17</elib> used a grasp selection strategy that was very similar
    to (and partly the inspiration for) the <a
    href="clutter.html#grasp_sampler">grasp sampler</a> we introduced in our
    antipodal grasping workflow. But in addition to the geometric heuristic,
    <elib>tenPas17</elib> trained a small CNN to predict grasp success.  The
    input to this CNN was a voxelized summary of the pixels and local geometry
    estimates in the immediate vicinity of the grasp, and the output was a
    binary prediction of grasp success or failure. Similarly,
    <elib>Mahler17</elib> learned a "grasp quality" CNN takes as input the
    depth image in the grasp frame (+ the grasp depth in the camera frame) and
    outputs a probability of grasp success.</p>

  <section id="exercises"><h1>Exercises</h1>
    <exercise id="don_contrastive"><h1>Deep Object Net and Contrastive Loss</h1>
      <p>In this problem you will further explore Dense Object Nets, which were introduced in lecture. Dense Object Nets are able to quickly learn consistent pixel-level representations for visual understanding and manipulation. Dense Object Nets are powerful because the representations they predict are applicable to both rigid and non-rigid objects. They can also generalize to new objects in the same class and can be trained with self-supervised learning. For this problem you will work in <script>document.write(notebook_link('deep_perception', notebook='contrastive', link_text='this notebook'))</script> to first implement the loss function used to train Dense Object Nets, and then predict correspondences between images using a trained Dense Object Net.</p>
