    "  - There exist other geometry formats, such as .stl, and .dae. These are not well-supported by Drake directly, but [Meshlab](https://www.meshlab.net/), an open-source software, is a handy tool to convert common formats to a `.obj` for you.\n",
    "- [Model directives](https://drake.mit.edu/doxygen_cxx/structdrake_1_1multibody_1_1parsing_1_1_model_directive.html) are a YAML specification that makes it easy to load multiple URDF and SDF objects into a simulation. They're used at the bottom of this notebook.\n"
