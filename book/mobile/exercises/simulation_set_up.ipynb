    "\n",
    "URDF and SDF are both XML formats that can specify the kinematic and dynamic properties of robots or objects. URDF can only specify the kinematic and dynamic properties of a single robot in isolation. It can't specify joint loops or things that are not robots, such as lights, heightmaps, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "SDFormat is a complete description for everything from the world level down to the robot level. Being more scalable, it is the recommended format. However, they should be mostly interchangeable with small syntax differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a high-level sense, you express different components of your robot using `<link>` tags and connect them via `<joint>` tags. Each `<link>` has three major subtags, `<visual>`, `<collision>`, and `<inertial>`, for its visualization, planning/collision checking, and dynamics aspects. For `<visual>` and `<collision>`, you can either use primitive shapes (box, sphere, cylinder, etc.) or tailored meshes (.obj, .gltf) to represent the underlying geometry. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here are two useful resources for [URDF](https://wiki.ros.org/urdf/Tutorials/Building%20a%20Visual%20Robot%20Model%20with%20URDF%20from%20Scratch) and [SDFormat](https://classic.gazebosim.org/tutorials?tut=build_model) creation. ([Another SDF reference](http://sdformat.org/spec))"

For meshes, glTF (.gltf) is the preferred format in Drake for visualization. Wavefront OBJ (.obj) is another well-supported alternative. obj files will often come with material descriptions or (.mtl) files that they reference. If you have other file formats (eg .stl, .dae), [Meshlab](https://www.meshlab.net/), an open-source software, is a handy tool to convert common formats to a .obj. \n",

You can convert meshes into sdf's using [manipulation/create_sdf_from_mesh.py](https://github.com/RussTedrake/manipulation/blob/master/manipulation/create_sdf_from_mesh.py), which additionally supports convex decomposition of a nonconvex mesh and mesh simplification.\n"

    "**Part (a):**  How is the collision geometry and or contact models different in File 1 than File 2? What benefit do we have from having different collision geometries in both of these versions of the sugar box? (Hint: Which file has hydroelastic contact? You can also look through Chapter 5 specfically [5.2.2-5.2.4](https://manipulation.csail.mit.edu/clutter.html#section2) or read through [this blog post](https://medium.com/toyotaresearch/rethinking-contact-simulation-for-robot-manipulation-434a56b5ec88))\n",
