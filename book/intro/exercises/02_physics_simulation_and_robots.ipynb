    "\n",
    "First, let's load a real robot! The **IIWA14** is a 7-DOF industrial robot arm from KUKA. Drake includes many robot models that you can load directly from Drake, which is what we will do in this part.\n",
    "\n",
    "**YOUR TASK:** Load and visualize the IIWA14 robot using Drake's physics engine.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Concepts:**\n",
    "- `Parser`: Loads robots from robot description files (like URDF/SDF/MJCF) files into the physics engine\n",
    "- `MultibodyPlant`: Drake's main physics simulation engine for robots and objects. This will be the backbone for all of our simulations.\n",
    "- `SceneGraph`: Drake's module for handling everything related to registering robot and object geometries, handling geometry queries, collision detection, etc.\n",
    "- **Base Welding**: Fixing the robot base to the world frame is important so it doesn't fall!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reference:** For this part, we will closely follow the [Drake Simulation example](https://deepnote.com/workspace/Drake-0b3b2c53-a7ad-441b-80f8-bf8350752305/project/Tutorials-2b4fc509-aef2-417d-a40d-6071dfed9199/notebook/simulation-1ba6290623e34dbbb9d822a2180187c1) from [Chapter 2](https://manipulation.csail.mit.edu/robot.html) from the class textbook - in this part we will follow the **\"Simulating the (passive) iiwa\"** and **\"Visualizing the scene\"** sections closely. You should skim through those before you start the implementations below!"

    "\n",
    "**The Grand Finale!** Now we'll combine everything you've learned to create a complete simulation with both the IIWA14 robot and your custom initials asset!\n",
    "\n",
    "**YOUR TASK:** Build a physics simulation containing:\n",
    "1. **IIWA14 robot**: welded to the world frame as before.\n",
    "2. **Your custom table**: welded to the world frame near your robot (but not penetrating it!)\n",
    "3. **Your custom initials**: placed on top of your custom table.\n",
    "\n",
    "You now have all the tools you need to implement this yourself! Use the patterns you've learned from the previous parts to complete the notebook. When you are done, take a screen recording (must be an `.mp4` file with size below 500 MB) of the simulation and upload it to Gradescope.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Final Goal:** Use a screen recording tool to record a video of your simulated scene. The video should show your initials falling onto the table, which is welded in place close to the robot (but not penetrating it).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint**: `WeldFrames` takes a third argument a `RigidTransform` (which you will learn about later in the class). For now, you can just pass in a `(x,y,z)`-position with `RigidTransform([x,y,z])` to weld frames with an offset. (As always, if you are unsure about a function signature take a look at the [official documentation](https://drake.mit.edu/pydrake/pydrake.multibody.plant.html))\n"
