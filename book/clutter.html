<chapter style="counter-reset: chapter 4"><h1>Bin Picking</h1>

  <todo>Consider moving / teaching this BEFORE geometric pose estimation.  It could actually be nice to introduce cameras / point clouds with this material instead of with pose estimation.</todo>

  <p>In this chapter we'll consider the simplest version of the bin picking
  problem: the robot has a bin full of random objects and simply needs to move
  those objects from one bin to the other.  We'll be agnostic about what those
  objects are and about where they end up in the other bin, but we would like
  our solution to achieve a reasonable level of performance for a very wide
  variety of objects.  This turns out to be a pretty convenient way to create a
  training ground for robot learning -- we can set the robot up to move objects
  back and forth between bins all day and night, and intermittently add and
  remove objects from the bin to improve diversity.  Of course, it is even
  easier in simulation!</p>

  <p>Bin picking has potentially very important applications in industries such
  as logistics, and there are significantly more refined versions of this
  problem. For example, we might need to pick only objects from a specific
  class, and/or place the objects in known position (e.g. for "packing").  But
  let's start with the basic case.</p>

  <section><h1>Generating random cluttered scenes</h1>
  
    <p>If our goal is to test a diversity of bin picking situations, then the
    first task is to figure out how to generate diverse simulations.  How
    should we populate the bin full of objects?  So far we've set up each
    simulation by carefully setting the initial positions (in the
    <code>Context</code>) for each of the objects, but that approach won't
    scale.</p>

    <subsection><h1>Falling things</h1>

      <p>In the real world, we would probably just dump the random objects into
      the bin.  That's a decent strategy for simulation, too.  We can roughly
      expect our simulation to faithfully implement multibody physics as long
      as our initial conditions (and time step) are reasonable; but the physics
      isn't well defined if we initialize the <code>Context</code> with
      multiple objects occupying the same physical space.  The simplest and
      most common way to avoid this is to generate a random number of objects
      in random poses, with their vertical positions staggered so that they
      trivially start out of penetration.</p>

      <p>If you look for them, you can find animations of large numbers of
      falling objects in the demo reels for most advanced multibody simulators.
      (These demos can potentially be a bit misleading; it's relatively easy to
      make a simulation which lots of objects falling that looks relatively
      good from a distance, but if you zoom in and look closely you'll often
      find many anomalies.) For our purposes the falling dynamics themselves
      are not the focus. We just want the state of the objects when they are
      done falling as initial conditions for our manipulation system.</p>

      <todo>maybe cite the falling things paper, but make it clear that the idea
      is not new?</todo></p>

      <example><h1>Piles of foam bricks in 2D</h1>

        <p>Here is the 2D case.  I've added many instances of our favorite red
        foam brick to the plant.  Note that it's possible to write highly
        optimized simulators that take advantage of physics being restricted to
        2D; that's not what I've done here.  Rather, I've added a planar joint
        connecting each brick to the world, and run our full 3D simulator.  The
        planar joint has three degrees of freedom.  I've oriented them here to
        be $x$, $z$, and $\theta$ to constrain the objects to the $xz$
        plane.</p>

        <p>I've set the initial positions for each object in the
        <code>Context</code> to be uniformly distributed over the horizontal
        position, uniformly rotated, and staggered every 0.1m in their initial
        vertical position.  We only have to simulate for a little more than a
        second for the bricks to come to rest and give us our intended "initial
        conditions".</p>

          <p pdf="only"><a href="data/falling_bricks_2d.html">Click here for the animation.</a></p>
        </figure>

      </example>

      <p>It's not really any different to do this with any random objects --
      here is what it looks like when I run the same code, but replace the
      brick with a random draw from a few objects from the YCB dataset
      <elib>Calli17</elib>.  It somehow amuses me that we can see the <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_limit_theorem">central limit
      theorem</a> hard at work, even when our objects are slightly
      ridiculous.</p>

      <figure>
      <img style="width:70%" src="data/ycb_planar_clutter.png"/>
      </figure>

      <example><h1>Filling bins with clutter</h1>

        <p>The same technique also works in 3D.  Setting uniformly random
        orientations in 3D requires a little more thought, but Drake supplies
        the method <code>UniformlyRandomRotationMatrix</code> (and also one for
        quaternions and roll-pitch-yaw) to do that work for us.</p>

        <script>document.write(notebook_link('clutter', 'falling_things'))</script>

          <img style="width:70%" src="data/ycb_clutter.png"/>
        </figure>

      </example>

      <p>Please appreciate that bins are a particularly simple case for
      generating random scenarios. If you wanted to generate random kitchen
      environments, for example, then you won't be as happy with a solution
      that drops refrigerators, toasters, and stools from uniformly random
      i.i.d. poses.  In those cases, authoring reasonable distributions gets
      much more interesting <elib>Izatt20</elib>; we will revisit the topic of
      generative scene models later in the notes.</p>

  <section><h1>Static equilibrium with frictional contact</h1>

    <p>Although the examples above are conceptually very simple, there is
    actually a lot going on in the physics engine to make all of this work.
    To appreciate a few of the details, let's explore the easiest case -- the
    (static) mechanics once all of the objects have come to rest.</p>

    <p>I won't dive into a full discussion of multibody dynamics nor multibody
    simulation, though I do have more notes <a
    href="http://underactuated.mit.edu/multibody.html">available here</a>. What
    is important to understand is that the familiar $f=ma$ takes a particular
    form when we write it down in terms of the generalized positions, $q$, and
    velocities, $v$: $$M(q)\dot{v} + C(q,v)v = \tau_g(q) + \sum_i
    J^T_i(q)F^{c_i}.$$  We already understand the generalized positions, $q$,
    and velocities, $v$. The left side of the equation is just a generalization
    of "mass times acceleration", with the mass matrix, $M$, and the Coriolis
    terms $C$. The right hand side is the sum of the (generalized) forces, with
    $\tau_g(q)$ capturing the terms due to gravity, and $F^{c_i}$ is the
    spatial force due to the $i$th contact.  $J_i(q)$ is the $i$th "contact
    Jacobian" -- it is the Jacobian that maps from the generalized velocities
    to the spatial velocity of the $i$th contact frame.</p>

    <p>Our interest here is in finding (stable) steady-state solutions to
    these differential equations that can serve as good initial conditions
    for our simulation.  At steady-state we have $v=\dot{v}=0$, and
    conveniently all of the terms on the left-hand side of the equations are
    zero.  This leaves us with just the force-balance equations $$\tau_g(q) =
    - \sum_i J^T_i(q) F^{c_i}.$$</p>

    <subsection id="spatial_force"><h1>Spatial force</h1>

      <p>Before we proceed, let's be a little more careful about our force
      notation, and define it's spatial algebra. Often we think of forces as a
      three-element vector (with components for $x$, $y$, and $z$) applied to a
      rigid body at some point.  More generally, we will define a six-component
      vector for <a
      href="https://drake.mit.edu/doxygen_cxx/group__multibody__spatial__vectors.html"><i>spatial
      force</i></a>, using the monogram notation:
      \begin{equation}F^{B_p}_{{\text{name}},C} = \begin{bmatrix}
      \tau^{B_p}_{\text{name},C} \\ f^{B_p}_{\text{name},C} \end{bmatrix} \quad
      \text{ or, if you prefer } \quad \left[F^{B_p}_{\text{name}}\right]_C =
      \begin{bmatrix} \left[\tau^{B_p}_{\text{name}}\right]_C \\
      \left[f^{B_p}_{\text{name}}\right]_C \end{bmatrix}.\end{equation}
      $F^{B_p}_{\text{name},C}$ is the named spatial force applied to a point,
      or frame origin, $B_p$, expressed in frame $C$. The form with the
      parentheses is preferred in Drake, but is a bit too verbose for my taste
      here in the notes.  The name is optional, and the expressed in frame, if
      unspecified, is the world frame. For forces in particular, it is
      recommended that we include the body, $B$, that the force is being
      applied to in the symbol for the point $B_p$, especially since we will
      often have equal and opposite forces. In code, we write
      <code>Fname_Bp_C</code>.</p>
      
      <p>Like spatial velocity, spatial forces have a rotational component and
      a translational component; $\tau^{B_p}_C \in \Re^3$ is the <i>torque</i>
      (on body $B$ applied at point $p$ expressed in frame $C$), and
      $f^{B_p}_C \in \Re^3$ is the translational or Cartesian force. A
      spatial force is also commonly referred to as a <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screw_theory#Wrench">wrench</a>. If
      you find it strange to think of forces as having a rotational
      component, then think of it this way: the world might only impart
      Cartesian forces at the points of contact, but we often want to
      summarize the combined effect of many Cartesian forces applied to
      different points into one common frame. To do this, we represent the
      equivalent effect of each Cartesian force at the point of application
      as a force
      <i>and</i> a torque applied at a different point on the body.</p>

      <p id="spatial_force_algebra">Spatial forces fit neatly into our spatial algebra:
      <ul>
        <li>Spatial forces add when they are applied to the same body in the
        same frame, e.g.: \begin{equation}F^{B_p}_{\text{total},C}
        = \sum_i F^{B_p}_{i,C} .\end{equation}</li>
        <li>Shifting a spatial force from one application point, $B_p$, to
        another point, $B_q$, uses the cross product: \begin{equation} f^{B_q}_C
        = f^{B_p}_C, \qquad \tau^{B_q}_C = \tau^{B_p}_C + {}^{B_q}p^{B_p}_C
        \times f^{B_p}_C.\label{eq:spatial_force_shift}\end{equation}</li>
        <li>As with all spatial vectors, rotations can be used to change
        between the "expressed-in" frames: \begin{equation} f^{B_p}_D = {}^DR^C
        f^{B_p}_C, \qquad \tau^{B_p}_D = {}^DR^C
        \tau^{B_p}_C.\end{equation}</li>
      </ul>
      </p>
  
    </subsection>

    <subsection><h1>Collision geometry</h1>

      <p>Now that we have our notation, we next need to understand where the
      contact forces come from.</p>

      <p>Geometry engines for robotics, like <code>SceneGraph</code> in
      <drake></drake>, distinguish between a few different <a
      href="https://drake.mit.edu/doxygen_cxx/group__geometry__roles.html">roles</a>
      that geometry can play in a simulation.  In <a
      href="http://sdformat.org/spec">robot description files</a>, we
      distinguish between <a
      href="http://sdformat.org/spec?ver=1.8&elem=link">visual</a>
      and <a
      href="http://sdformat.org/spec?ver=1.8&elem=collision">collision</a>
      geometries.  In particular, every rigid body in the simulation can have
      multiple
      <i>collision</i>
      geometries associated with it (playing the "proximity" role). Collision
      geometries are often much simpler than the visual geometries we use for
      illustration and simulating perception -- sometimes they are just a
      low-polygon-count version of the visual mesh and sometimes we actually
      use much simpler geometry (like boxes, spheres, and cylinders).  These
      simpler geometries make the physics engine faster and more robust.</p>

    <!--
    <p>For subtle reasons we will explore below, in addition to simplifying
    the geometry, we sometimes over-parameterize the collision geometry in
    order to make the numerics more robust.  For example, when we simulate
    the red brick, we actually use <i>nine</i> collision geometries for
    the one body.</p>

    <figure><img style="width:50%"
    src="data/foam_brick_contact_geometry.png"/><figcaption>The (exaggerated)
    contact geometry used for robust simulation of boxes.  We add contact
    "points" (epsilon radius spheres) to each corner, and have a slightly
    inset box for the remaining contacts.  <a
    href="data/foam_brick_contact_geometry.html">Here</a> is the interactive
    version.</figcaption></figure>
    -->

    <example><h1>Collision geometry inspector</h1>
    
      <p>Drake's has a very useful <code>ModelVisualizer</code> tool that
      publishes by the illustration and collision geometry roles to Meshcat
      (see, for example, the Drake <script>document.write(drake_tutorials_link(
        'authoring_multibody_simulation',
        link_text='tutorial on authoring multibody simulations'))
      </script>). This is very useful for designing new models, but also for 
      understanding the contact geometry of existing models.</p>

      <p>We used this tool before, when we were visualizing the various robot
      models. Go ahead and try it again; navigate in the meshcat controls to
      <code>Scene > drake > proximity</code> and check the box to enable
      visualizing the geometries with the proximity role.</p>

      <script>document.write(notebook_link('robot', notebook='inspector'))</script>
      
      <figure>
        <img width="50%"" src="figures/ur3e_collision_geo.png"/>
        <figcaption>Visualizing the visual and collision geometries for the
        UR3e.</figcaption>
      </figure>

    </example>

    <p>SceneGraph also implements the concept of a <a
    href="https://drake.mit.edu/doxygen_cxx/classdrake_1_1geometry_1_1_collision_filter_declaration.html">collision
    filter</a>.  It can be important to specify that, for instance, the iiwa
    geometry at link 5 cannot collide with the geometry in links 4 or 6.
    Specifying that some collisions should be ignored not only speeds up the
    computation, but it also facilitates the use of simplified collision
    geometry for links.  It would be extremely hard to approximate link 4 and
    5 accurately with spheres, and cylinders if I had to make sure that those
    spheres and cylinders did not overlap in any feasible joint angle.  The
    default collision filter settings should work fine for most applications,
    but you can tweak them if you like.</p>

    <p>So where do the contact forces, $f^{c_i}$, come from?  There is
    potentially an equal and opposite contact (spatial) force for every
    <i>pair</i> of collision geometries that are not filtered out by the
    collision filter. In <code>SceneGraph</code>, the <a
    href="https://drake.mit.edu/doxygen_cxx/classdrake_1_1geometry_1_1_scene_graph_inspector.html#a79b84ada25718e2a38fd2d13adb4d839"><code>GetCollisionCandidates</code></a>
    method returns them all.  We'll take to calling the two bodies in a collision pair "body A" and "body B".</p>

  </subsection>

  <subsection><h1>Contact forces between bodies in collision</h1>

    <p>In our mathematical models, two bodies would never occupy the same
    region of space, but in a simulation using numerical integration, this can
    rarely be avoided completely. Most simulators summarize the contact forces
    between two bodies that are in collision -- either touching or overlapping
    -- as Cartesian forces at one or more contact points. It's easy to
    underestimate this step!</p>

    <p>First, let's appreciate the sheer number of cases that we have to get
    right in the code; it's unfortunately extremely common for open-source
    tools to have bugs in here. But I think this gui also makes it pretty
    apparent that asking to summarize the forces between two bodies in deep
    penetration with a single Cartesian force applied at a point is fraught
    with peril. As you move the objects, you will find many discontinuities;
    this is a common reason why you sometimes see rigid body simulations
    "explode".  It might seem natural to try to use multiple contact points
    instead of a single contact point to summarize the forces, and some
    simulators do, but it is very hard to write an algorithm that only depends
    on the current configurations of the geometry which selects contact points
    consistently from one time step to the next.</p>

    <p>One of the innovations in Drake which makes it particularly good at simulating complex contact situations is that we have moved away from point contact models. When we enable <a href="https://drake.mit.edu/doxygen_cxx/group__hydroelastic__user__guide.html">hydroelastic contact in Drake</a>, the spatial forces between two penetrating bodies are computed by taking an integral over a "hydroelastic surface" which generalizes the notion of a contact patch <elib>Elandt19</elib>. As of this writing, you still have to "opt-in" to using hydroelastic in Drake (see <script>document.write(drake_tutorials_link(
      'hydroelastic_contact_basics',
                ext='this tutorial on hydroelastic'))
    </script>); I'm working to use it in all of my examples in these notes.</p>

    <todo>More about hydroelastic here.  Show some of the nice videos.
      https://youtu.be/5-k2Pc6OmzE</todo>

    <example><h1>Contact force inspector</h1>
        
      <p>I've created a simple GUI that allows you to pick any two primitive
      geometry types and inspect the hydroelastic contact information that is
      computed when those object are put into penetration.
      </p>

      <script>document.write(notebook_link('clutter', 'contact_inspector'))</script>

    </example>



  </subsection>

  <subsection><h1>The Contact Frame</h1>

    <p>We still need to decide the magnitude and direction of these spatial
    forces, and to do this we need to specify the
    <i>contact frame</i> in which the spatial force is to be applied.  For
    instance, we <a
    href="https://drake.mit.edu/doxygen_cxx/classdrake_1_1multibody_1_1_point_pair_contact_info.html">might
    use</a> $C_B$ to denote a contact frame on body $B$, with the forces
    applied at the origin of the frame.</p>

    <p>Although I strongly advocate for using the hydroelastic contact model in
    your simulations, for the purposes of exposition, let's think about the
    point contact model here. If the collision engine produces a number of
    contact point locations, how should we define the frames?</p>
    
    <p>Our convention will be to align the positive $z$ axis with the "contact
    normal", with positive forces resisting penetration. Defining this normal
    also requires care.  For instance, what is the normal at the corner of a
    box?  Taking the normal as a (<a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subderivative">sub-</a>)gradient of the
    signed-distance function between two bodies provides a reliable definition
    that will extend into generalized coordinates. The $x$ and $y$ axes of the
    contact frame are any orthogonal basis for the tangential coordinates.  You
    can find additional figures and explanations <a
    href="https://underactuated.csail.mit.edu/multibody.html#contact">here</a>.</p>

    <example><h1>Brick on a half-plane</h1>

      <p>Let's work through these details on a simple example -- our foam
      brick sitting on the ground.  The ground is welded to the world, so has
      no degrees of freedom; we can ignore the forces applied to the ground
      and focus on the forces applied to the brick.</p>

      <p>Where are the contact forces and contact frames?  If we used only
      box-on-box geometry, then the choice of contact force location is not
      unique during this "face-on-face" contact; this is even more true in 3D
      (where three forces would be sufficient). Let's assume for a moment
      that our contact engine determines two points of contact -- one at each
      corner of the box. (In order to help the contact engine make robust
      choices when we are using point contact models, we sometimes actually
      <a href="data/foam_brick_contact_geometry.html">annotate the boxes with
      small sphere collision geometries in the eight corners</a>; this is not
      needed when using hydroelastic contact.) I've labeled the frames $C_1$
      and $C_2$ in the sketch below.</p>

      <figure>
        <img src="data/brick_on_half_plane.jpg" width=50%/>
      </figure>

      <p>In order to achieve static equilibrium, we require that all of the
      forces and torques on the brick be in balance. We have three forcesto
      consider: $F_{g}, F_1,$ and $F_2$, named using shorthand for gravity,
      contact 1, and contact 2, respectively. The gravity vector is most
      naturally described in the world frame, applied to the body at the center
      of mass: $$F_{g, W}^B = \begin{bmatrix} 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -mg
      \end{bmatrix}^T.$$ The contact forces are most naturally described in the
      contact frames; for instance we know that $$f_{1, C_1,z}^{B_{c_1}} \ge
      0,$$ because the force cannot pull on the ground. To write the force
      balance equation, we need to use our spatial algebra to express all of
      the spatial forces in the same frame, and apply them at the same
      point.</p>

      <p>For instance, if we are to transform contact force 1, we can first
      change the frame: $$F_{1,B}^{B_{c_1}} = {}^B R^{C_1}
      F_{1,C_{1}}^{B_{c_1}}.$$ Then we can change the point at which it's
      applied: $$f_{1,B}^B = f_{1,B}^{B_{c_1}}, \qquad \tau_{1,B}^B =
      \tau_{1,B}^{B_{C_1}} + {}^Bp_B^{B_{C_1}} \times f_{1,B}^{B_{c_1}}.$$ We
      can now solve for the force balance: $$F_{1,B}^B + F_{2,B}^B + F_{g,B}^B
      = 0,$$ which is six equations in 3D (or only three in 2D). The
      translational components tell me that $$f_{1,B}^B + f_{2,B}^B =
      \begin{bmatrix}0 \\ 0 \\ mg\end{bmatrix},$$ but it's the <i>torque</i>
      component in $y$ that tells me that $f_{1,B_z}$ and $f_{2,B_z}$ must be
      equal if the center of mass is equally distance from the two contact
      points.</p>
      
      <p>We haven't said anything about the horizontal
      forces yet, except that they must balance. Let's develop that
      next.</p>

    </example>
    
  </subsection>

  <subsection><h1>The (Coulomb) Friction Cone</h1>

    <p>Now the rules governing contact forces can begin to take shape.  First
    and foremost, we demand that there is no force at a distance. Using
    $\phi_i(q)$ to denote the distance between two bodies in configuration
    $q$, we have $$\phi(q) > 0 \Rightarrow f^{c_i} = 0.$$  Second, we demand
    that the normal force only resists penetration; bodies are never pulled
    into contact: $$f^{c_i}_{C_z} \ge 0.$$  In <i>rigid</i> contact models, we
    solve for the smallest normal force enforces the non-penetration
    constraint (this is known as the principle of least constraint).  In
    <i>soft</i> contact models, we define the force to be a function of the
    penetration depth and velocity.</p>  <todo>Citations</todo>

    <todo>Need figures here</todo>

    <p>Forces in the tangential directions are due to friction.  The most
    commonly used model of friction is Coulomb friction, which states that
    $$\sqrt{{f^{c_i}_{C_x}}^2 + {f^{c_i}_{C_y}}^2} \le \mu f^{c_i}_{C_z},$$ with $\mu$ a
    non-negative scalar <i>coefficient of friction</i>.  Typically we define
    both a $\mu_{static}$, which is applied when the tangential velocity is
    zero, and $\mu_{dynamic}$, applied when the tangential velocity is
    non-zero. In the Coulomb friction model, the tangential contact force is
    the force within this friction cone which produces maximum dissipation.
    </p>

    <p>Taken together, the geometry of these constraints forms a <a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_cone">cone</a> of admissable
    contact forces.  It is famously known as the "friction cone", and we will
    refer to it often.</p>

    <p>It's a bit strange for us to write that the forces are in some set.
    Surely the world will pick just one force to apply? It can't apply all
    forces in a set.  The friction cone specifies the range of possible
    forces; under the Coulomb friction model we say that the one force that
    will be picked is the force inside this set that will successfully resist
    relative motion in the contact x-y frame. If no force inside the friction
    cone can completely resist the motion, then we have sliding, and we say
    that the force that the world will apply is the force inside the friction
    cone of <i>maximal dissipation</i>. For the conic friction cone, this
    will be pointed in the direction opposite of the sliding velocity. So
    even though the world will indeed "pick" one force from the friction cone
    to apply, it can still be meaningful to reason about the set of possible
    forces that could be applied because those denote the set of possible
    opposing forces that friction can perfectly resist. For instance, a brick
    under gravity will not move if we can exactly oppose the force of gravity
    with a force inside the friction cone.</p>

    <example><h1>Brick on an inclined half-plane</h1>

      <p>If we take our last example, but tilt the table to an angle relative
      to gravity, then the horizontal forces start becoming important.
      Before going through the equations, let's check your intuition.  Will
      the magnitude of the forces on the two corners stay the same in this
      configuration?  Or will there be more contact force on the lower
      corner?</p>

      <figure>
        <img src="data/brick_incline.jpg" width=50%/>
      </figure>

      <p>In the illustration above, you'll notice that the contact frames
      have rotated so that the $z$ axis is aligned with the contact normals.
      I've sketched two possible friction cones (dark green and lighter
      green), corresponding to two different coefficients of friction.  We
      can tell immediately by inspection that the smaller value of $\mu$
      (corresponding to the darker green) cannot produce contact forces that
      will completely counteract gravity (the friction cone does not contain
      the vertical line).  In this case, the box will slide and no static
      equilibrium exists in this configuration.</p>

      <p>If we increase the coefficient of (static) friction to the range
      corresponding to the lighter green, then we can find contact forces that
      produce an equilibrium.  Indeed, for this problem, we need some amount of
      friction to even have an equilibrium (we'll explore this in the <a
      href="#static_equilibrium">exercises</a>).  We also need for the vertical
      projection of the center of mass onto the ramp to land between the two
      contact points, otherwise the brick will tumble over the bottom edge.  We
      can see this by writing our same force/torque balance equations.  We can
      write them applied at and expressed in body frame, B, assuming the center
      of mass in the center of the brick and the brick has length $l$ and
      height $h$:\begin{gather*} f^{B}_{1, B_x} + f^{B}_{2, B_x} =
      -mg\sin\gamma \\ f^{B}_{1,B_z}  + f^{B}_{2,B_z} = mg\cos\gamma \\ -h
      f^{B}_{1,B_x} + l f^{B}_{1,B_z} = h f^{B}_{2,B_x} + l f^{B}_{2, B_z} \\
      f^{B}_{1, B_z} \ge 0, \quad f^{B}_{2, B_z} \ge 0 \\ |f^{B}_{1, B_x}| \le
      \mu f^{B}_{1, B_z}, \quad |f^{B}_{2, B_x}| \le \mu f^{B}_{2, B_z}
      \end{gather*} </p>

      <p>So, are the magnitude of the contact forces the same or different?
      Substituting the first equation into the third reveals $$f^{B}_{2, B_z}
      = f^{B}_{1, B_z} + \frac{mgh}{l}\sin\gamma.$$</p>
    
    </example>

  <subsection><h1>Static equilibrium as an optimization problem</h1>

    <p>Rather than dropping objects from a random height, perhaps we can
    initialize our simulations using optimization to find the initial
    conditions that are already in static equilibrium.  In <drake></drake>,
    the
    <a
    href="https://drake.mit.edu/doxygen_cxx/classdrake_1_1multibody_1_1_static_equilibrium_problem.html"><code>StaticEquilbriumProblem</code></a>
    collects all of the constraints we enumerated above into an optimization
    problem: \begin{align*} \find_q \quad \subjto \quad& \tau_g(q) = - \sum_i
    J^T_i(q) f^{c_i} & \\ & f^{c_i}_{C_z} \ge 0 & \forall i, \\ &
    |f^{c_i}_{C_{x,y}}|_2 \le \mu f^{c_i}_{C_z} & \forall i, \\ & \phi_i(q)
    \ge 0 & \forall i, \\ & \phi(q) = 0 \textbf{ or } f^{c_i}_{C_z} = 0
    &\forall i, \\ & \text{joint limits}.\end{align*} This is a nonlinear
    optimization problem: it includes the nonconvex non-penetration
    constraints we discussed in the last chapter.  The second-to-last
    constraints (a logical or) is particularly interesting; constraints of
    the form $x \ge 0, y \ge 0, x =0 \textbf{ or } y = 0$ are known as
    complementarity constraints, and are often written as $x \ge 0, y \ge 0,
    xy = 0$.  We can make the problem easier for the nonlinear optimization
    solver by relaxing the equality to $0 \le \phi(q) f^{c_i}_{C_z} \le
    \text{tol}$, which provides a proper gradient for the optimizer to follow
    at the cost of allowing some force at a distance.</p>  
    
    <p>It's easy to add additional costs and constraints; for initial
    conditions we might use an objective that keeps $q$ close to an initial
    configuration-space sample.</p>

  <section><h1>Model-based grasp selection</h1>

    <p>What makes a good grasp? This topic has been studied extensively for
    decades in robotics, with an original focus on thinking of a (potentially
    dexterous) hand interacting with a known object.
    <elib>Prattichizzo08</elib> is an excellent survey of that literature; I
    will summarize just a few of the key ideas here.</p>

    <p>If the goal of a grasp is to stabilize an object in the hand, then one
    definition of a "good grasp" is be one that is able to resist
    disturbances described by an "adversarial" wrench applied to the body.</p>

    <subsection><h1>The contact wrench cone</h1>

      <p>Above, we introduced the friction cone as the range of possible forces
      that friction is able to produce in order to resist motion. For the
      purposes of grasp planning, by applying the additive inverse to the
      forces in the friction cone, we can obtain all of the "adversarial"
      forces that can be resisted at the point of contact. And to understand
      the total ability of all contact forces (applied at multiple points of
      contact) to resist motion of the body, we want to somehow add all of
      these forces together. Fortunately, the spatial algebra for spatial
      forces can be readily extended from operating on spatial force vectors to
      operating on entire sets of spatial forces.</p>

      <p>Because our sets of interest here are convex cones, I will use the
      relatively standard choice of $\mathcal{K}$ for the six-dimensional
      <i>wrench cone</i>. Specifically, we have
      $\mathcal{K}^{B_p}_{\text{name}, C}$ for the cone corresponding to
      potential spatial forces for $F^{B_p}_{\text{name}, C}$. For instance,
      our Coulomb friction cone for the point contact model (which, as we've
      defined it, has no torsional friction) in the contact frame could be:
      \begin{equation}\mathcal{K}^C_C = \left\{ \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\
      f^{C}_{C_x} \\ f^C_{C_y} \\ f^C_{C_z} \end{bmatrix} : \sqrt{
      \left(f^{C}_{C_x}\right)^2 + \left(f^{C}_{C_y}\right)^2 } \le \mu
      f^C_{C_z} \right\}.\end{equation}</p>

      <p id="wrench_cone_algebra">The spatial algebra for spatial forces can be applied directly to the
      wrench cones:
        <ul>
          <li>For addition of wrenches applied at the same point and expressed
          in the same frame, the interpretation we seek is that the cone formed
          by the sum of wrench cones describes the set of wrenches that could
          be obtained by choosing one element from each of the individual cones
          and summing them up. This set operator is the <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minkowski_addition">Minkowski
          sum</a>, which we denote with $\oplus$, e.g.:
          \begin{equation}\mathcal{K}^{B_p}_{\text{total},C}=
          \mathcal{K}^{B_p}_{0,C} \oplus \mathcal{K}^{B_p}_{1,C} \oplus
          \cdots\end{equation}</li>
          <li>Shifting a wrench cone from one application frame, $B_p$, to
          another frame, $B_q$, is a linear operation on the cones; to
          emphasize that I will write Eq $\ref{eq:spatial_force_shift}$ in
          matrix form: \begin{equation} \mathcal{K}^{B_q}_C = \begin{bmatrix}
          I_{3 \times 3} & \left[ {}^{B_q}p^{B_p}_C \right]_\times \\ 0_{3
          \times 3} & I_{3 \times 3} \end{bmatrix}
          \mathcal{K}^{B_p}_C,\end{equation} where the notation $[p]_{\times}$
          is the skew-symmetric matrix corresponding to the cross product.</li>
          <li>Rotations can be used to change between the "expressed-in"
          frames: \begin{equation} \mathcal{K}^{B_p}_D = \begin{bmatrix} {}^DR^C
          & 0_{3 \times 3} \\ 0_{3 \times 3} & {}^DR^C \end{bmatrix}
          \mathcal{K}^{B_p}_C.\end{equation}</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <example><h1>A contact wrench cone visualization</h1>

        <p>I've made a simple interactive visualization for you to play with to
        help your intuition about these wrench cones. I have a box that fixed
        in space and only subjected to contact forces (no gravity is
        illustrated here); I've drawn the friction cone at the point of contact
        and at the center of the body. Note that I've intentionally disabled
        hydroelastic contact for this example -- the forces are computed using
        only a single contact point between each collision pair -- to simplify
        the interpretation.</p>
        
        <p>There is one major caveat: the wrench cone lines in $\Re^6$, but I
        can only draw cones in $\Re^3$. So I've made the (standard) choice to
        draw the projection of the 6d cone into 3d space with two cones: one
        for the translational components (in green for the contact point and
        again in red for the body frame) and another for the rotational
        components (in blue for the body frame). This can be slightly
        misleading because one cannot actually select independently from both
        sets.</p>

        <script>document.write(notebook_link('clutter', 'contact_wrench'))</script>

        <p>Here is the contact wrench cone for a single contact point, visualized for two different contact locations:</p>
        <figure>
          <img src="figures/contact_wrench_1.png" width="40%">
          <img src="figures/contact_wrench_2.png" width="40%">
        </figure>
        <p>I hope that you immediately notice that the rotational component of
        the wrench cone is low dimensional -- due to the cross product, all
        vectors in that space must be orthogonal to the vector ${}^Bp^C$. Of
        course it's way better to run the notebook yourself and get the 3d
        interactive visualization.</p>

        <p>Here is the contact wrench cone for a two contact points on that are
        directly opposite from each other:</p>
        <figure>
          <img src="figures/contact_wrench_3.png" width="50%">
        </figure>
        <p>Notice that while each of the rotational cones are low dimensional,
        they span different spaces. Together (as understood by the Minkowski
        sum of these two sets) they can resist all pure torques applied at the
        body frame. This intuition is largely correct, but this is also where
        the projection of the 6d cone onto two 3d cones becomes a bit
        misleading. There are some wrenches that cannot be resisted by this
        grasp. Specifically, if I were to visualize the wrench cone at the
        point directly between the two contact points, we would see that the
        wrench cones <i>do not include</i> torques applied directly along the
        axis between the two contacts. The two contact points alone, without
        torsional friction, are unable to resist torques about that axis.</p>

        <p>In practice, the gripper model that we use in our simulation
        workflow uses hydroelastic contact, which simulates a contact patch and
        <i>can</i> produce torsional friction -- so we can resist moments
        around this axis. The exact amount one gets will be proportional to how
        hard the gripper is squeezing the object.</p>

      </example>

      <p>Now we can compute the cone of possible wrenches that any set of
      contacts can apply on a body -- the contact wrench cone -- by putting all
      of the individual contact wrench cones into a common frame and summing
      them together. A classic metric for grasping would say that a good grasp
      is one where the contact wrench cone is large (can resist many
      adversarial wrench disturbances). If the contact wrench cone is all of
      $\Re^6$, then we say the contacts have a achieved <i>force
      closure</i><elib>Prattichizzo08</elib>.</p>

      <p>It's worth mentioning that the elegant (linear) spatial algebra of the wrench cones also makes these quantities very suitable for use in optimization (e.g. <elib>Dai16</elib>).</p>

    </subsection>

    <subsection id="antipodal"><h1>Colinear antipodal grasps</h1>
    
      <p>The beauty of this wrench analysis originally inspires a very
      model-based analysis of grasping, where one could try to optimize the
      contact locations in order to maximize the contact wrench cone. But our
      goals for this chapter are to assume very little about the object that we
      are grasping, so we'll (for now) avoid optimizing over the surface of an
      object model for the best grasp location. Nevertheless, our model-based
      grasp analysis gives us a few very good heuristics for grasping even
      unknown objects.</p>

      <p>In particular, a good heuristic for a two fingered gripper to have a
      large contact wrench cone is to find colinear "antipodal" grasp points.
      Antipodal here means that the normal vectors of the contact (the $z$ axis
      of the contact frames) are pointing in exactly opposite directions. And
      "colinear" means that they are on the same line -- the line between the
      two contact points. As you can see in the two-fingered contact wrench
      visualization above, this is a reasonably strong heuristic for having a
      large total contact wrench cone. As we will see next, we can apply this
      heuristic even without knowing much of anything about the objects.</p>

  <section><h1>Grasp selection from point clouds</h1>

    <p>Rather than looking into the bin of objects, trying to recognize
    specific objects and estimate their pose, let's consider an approach where
    we simply look for graspable areas directly on the (unsegmented) point
    cloud. These very geometric approaches to grasp selection can work very
    well in practice, and can also be used in simulation to train a
    deep-learning-based grasp selection system that can work very well in the
    real world and even deal with partial views and occlusions
    <elib>tenPas17+Mahler17+Zeng18</elib>.</p>

    <subsection><h1>Point cloud pre-processing</h1>
    
      <p>To get a good view into the bin, we're going to set up multiple RGB-D
      cameras.  I've used three per bin in all of my examples here.  And those
      cameras don't only see the objects in the bin; they also see the bins, the
      other cameras, and anything else in the viewable workspace.  So we have a
      little work to do to merge the point clouds from multiple cameras into a
      single point cloud that only includes the area of interest.</p>

      <p>First, we can <i>crop</i> the point cloud to discard any points that
      are from outside the area of interest (which we'll define as an
      axis-aligned bounding box immediately above the known location of the
      bin).</p>

      <p>As we will discuss in some detail below, many of our grasp selection
      strategies will benefit from <i>estimating the "normals"</i> of the point
      cloud (a unit vector that estimates the normal direction relative to the
      surface of the underlying geometry).  It is actually better to estimate
      the normals on the individual point clouds, making use of the camera
      location that generated those points, than to estimate the normal after
      the point cloud has been merged.</p>
        
      <p>For sensors mounted on the real world, <i>merging point clouds</i>
      requires high-quality camera calibration and must deal with the messy
      depth returns.  All of the tools from the last chapter are relevant, as
      the tasks of merging the point clouds is another instance of the
      point-cloud-registration problem. For the perfect depth measurements we
      can get out of simulation, given known camera locations, we can skip this
      step and simply concatenate the list of points in the point clouds
      together.</p>

      <p>Finally, the resulting raw point clouds likely include many more points
      then we actually need for our grasp planning.  One of the standard
      approaches for <i>down-sampling</i> the point clouds is using a <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voxel">voxel</a> grid -- regularly
      sized cubes tiled in 3D.  We then summarize the original point cloud with
      exactly one point per voxel (see, for instance <a
      href="http://www.open3d.org/docs/latest/tutorial/Advanced/voxelization.html">Open3D's
      note on voxelization</a>).  Since point clouds typically only occupy a
      small percentage of the voxels in 3D space, we use sparse data structures
      to store the voxel grid.  In noisy point clouds, this voxelization step is
      also a useful form of filtering.</p>

      <example><h1>Mustard bottle point clouds</h1>

        <figure><img style="width:60%"
          src="data/mustard_normals.png"></figure>

          <script>document.write(notebook_link('clutter',  'point_cloud_processing'))</script>
      
        <p>I've produced a scene with three cameras looking at our favorite YCB
        mustard bottle.  I've taken the individual point clouds (already
        converted to the world frame by the
        <code>DepthImageToPointCloud</code> system), cropped the point clouds
        (to get rid of the geometry from the other cameras), estimated their
        normals, merged the point clouds, then down-sampled the point clouds.
        The order is important!</p>

        <p>I've pushed all of the point clouds to meshcat, but with many of them
        set to not be visible by default.  Use the drop-down menu to turn them
        on and off, and make sure you understand basically what is happening on
        each of the steps.  For this one, I can also give you the <a
        href="data/mustard_bottle_point_clouds.html">meshcat output
        directly</a>, if you don't want to run the code.</p>

      </example>

    </subsection>

    <subsection><h1>Estimating normals and local curvature</h1>
    
      <p>The grasp selection strategy that we will develop below will be based on the local geometry (normal direction and curvature) of the scene.  Understanding how to estimate those quantities from point clouds is an excellent exercise in point cloud processing, and is representative of other similar point cloud algorithms.</p>

      <p>Let's think about the problem of fitting a plane, in a least-squares
      sense, to a set of points<elib>Shakarji98</elib>. We can describe a plane
      in 3D with a position $p$ and a unit length normal vector, $n$.  The
      distance between a point $p^i$ and a plane is simply given by the
      magnitude of the inner product, $\left| (p^i - p)^T n \right|.$  So our
      least-squares optimization becomes $$\min_{p, n} \quad \sum_{i=1}^N
      \left| (p^i - p)^T n \right|^2, \quad \subjto \quad |n| = 1. $$  Taking
      the gradient of the Lagrangian with respect to $p$ and setting it equal
      to zero gives us that $$p^* = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N p^i.$$ Inserting
      this back into the objective, we can write the problem as $$\min_n n^T W
      n, \quad \subjto \quad |n|=1, \quad \text{where } W = \left[ \sum_i  (p^i
      - p^*) (p^i - p^*)^T \right].$$  Geometrically, this objective is a
      quadratic bowl centered at the origin, with a unit circle constraint.  So
      the optimal solution is given by the (unit-length) eigenvector
      corresponding to the <i>smallest</i> eigenvalue of the data matrix, $W$.
      And for any optimal $n$, the "flipped" normal $-n$ is also optimal.  We
      can pick arbitrarily for now, and then flip the normals in a
      post-processing step (to make sure that the normals all point towards the
      camera origin).</p>

      <p>What is really interesting is that the second and third
      eigenvalues/eigenvectors also tell us something about the local geometry.
      Because $W$ is symmetric, it has orthogonal eigenvectors, and these
      eigenvectors form a (local) basis for the point cloud.  The smallest
      eigenvalue pointed along the normal, and the <i>largest</i> eigenvalue
      corresponds to the direction of least curvature (the squared dot product
      with this vector is the largest).  This information can be very useful for
      finding and planning grasps.  <elib>tenPas17</elib> and others before them
      use this as a primary heuristic in generating candidate grasps.</p>
  
      <p>In order to approximate the local curvature of a mesh represented by a
      point cloud, we can use our fast nearest neighbor queries to find a
      handful of local points, and use this plane fitting algorithm on just
      those points. When doing normal estimation directly on a depth image,
      people often forgo the nearest-neighbor query entirely; simply using the
      approximation that neighboring points in pixel coordinates are often
      nearest neighbors in the point cloud.  We can repeat that entire
      procedure for every point in the point cloud.</p>  
      
      <p>I remember when working with point clouds started to become a bigger
      part of my life, I thought that surely doing anything moderately
      computational like this on every point in some dense point cloud would be
      incompatible with online perception.  But I was wrong! Even years ago,
      operations like this one were often used inside real-time perception
      loops. (And they pale in comparison to the number of <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FLOPS">FLOPs</a> we spend these days
      evaluating large neural networks).</p>

    <subsection id="grasp_candidates"><h1>Evaluating a candidate grasp</h1>

      <p>Now that we have processed our point cloud, we have everything we need
      to start planning grasps.  I'm going to break that discussion down into
      two steps.  In this section we'll come up with a cost function that scores
      grasp candidates.  In the following section, we'll discuss some very
      simple ideas for trying to find grasps candidates that have a low
      cost.</p>

      <p>Following our discussion of "model-based" grasp selection above, once
      we pick up an object -- or whatever happens to be between our fingers
      when we squeeze -- then we will expect the contact forces between our
      fingers to have to resist at least the <i>gravitational wrench</i> (the
      spatial force due to gravity) of the object.  The closing force provided
      by our gripper is in the gripper's $x$-axis, but if we want to be able to
      pick up the object without it slipping from our hands, then we need
      forces inside the friction cones of our contacts to be able to resist the
      gravitational wrench.  Since we don't know what that wrench will be (and
      are somewhat constrained by the geometry of our fingers), a reasonable
      strategy is to look the colinear antipodal points on the surface of the
      point cloud which also align with $x$-axis of the gripper. In a real
      point cloud, we are unlikely to find perfect antipodal pairs, but finding
      areas with normals pointing in nearly opposite directions is a good
      strategy for grasping!</p>

      <example><h1>Scoring grasp candidates</h1>

        <p>In practice, the contact between our fingers and the object(s) will
        be better described by a <i>patch contact</i> than by a point contact
        (due to the deflection of the rubber fingertips and any deflection of
        the objects being picked). So it makes sense to look for patches of
        points with agreeable normals. There are many ways one could write
        this, I've done it here by transforming the processed point cloud of
        the scene into the candidate frame of the gripper, and cropped away all
        of the points except the ones that are inside a bounding box between
        the finger tips (I've marked them in red in MeshCat).  The first term
        in my grasping cost function is just reward for all of the points in
        the point cloud, based on how aligned their normal is to the $x$-axis
        of the gripper: $$\text{cost} = -\sum_i (n^i_{G_x})^2,$$ where
        $n^i_{G_x}$ is the $x$ component of the $i$th point in the cropped
        point cloud expressed in the gripper frame.</p>

        <figure><img style="width:80%"
          src="data/grasp_candidate_evaluation.png"></figure>
    
        <p>There are other considerations for what might make a good grasp, too.
        For our kinematically limited robot reaching into a bin, we might favor
        grasps that put the hand in favorable orientation for the arm.  In the
        grasp metric I've implemented in the code, I added a cost for the hand
        deviating from vertical.  I can reward the dot product of the vector
        world $-z$ vector, $[0, 0, -1]$ with the $y$-axis in gripper frame
        rotated into world frame with : $$\text{cost} \mathrel{{+}{=}} -\alpha
        \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 &-1\end{bmatrix}R^G \begin{bmatrix}0 \\ 1 \\
        0\end{bmatrix} = \alpha R^G_{3,2},$$ where $\alpha$ is relative cost
        weight, and $R^G_{3,2}$ is the scalar element of the rotation matrix in
        the third row and second column.</p>        

        <p>Finally, we need to consider collisions between the candidate grasp
        and both the bins and with the point cloud.  I simply return infinite
        cost when the gripper is in collision.  I've implemented all of those
        terms in the notebook, and given you a sliders to move the hand around
        and see how the cost changes.</p>

        <script>document.write(notebook_link('clutter', 'grasp_selection'))</script>
    
      </example>

    </subsection>

    <subsection id="grasp_sampler"><h1>Generating grasp candidates</h1>

      <p>We've defined a cost function that, given a point cloud from the scene
      and a model of the environment (e.g. the location of the bins), can score
      a candidate grasp pose, $X^G$.  So now we would like to solve the
      optimization problem: find $X^G$ that minimizes the cost subject to the
      collision constraints.</p>

      <p>Unfortunately, this is an extremely difficult optimization problem,
      with a highly nonconvex objective and constraints.  Moreover, the cost
      terms corresponding to the antipodal points is zero for most $X^G$ --
      since most random $X^G$ will not have any points between the fingers.  As
      a result, instead of using the typical mathematical programming solvers,
      most approaches in the literature resort to a randomized sampling-based
      algorithm.  And we do have strong heuristics for picking reasonable
      samples.</p>

      <p>One heuristic, used for instance in <elib>tenPas17</elib>, is to use
      the local curvature of the point cloud to propose grasp candidates that
      have the point cloud normals pointing into the palm, and orients the hand
      so that the fingers are aligned with the direction of maximum curvature.
      One can move the hand in the direction of the normal until the fingers are
      out of collision, and even sample nearby points.  We have written <a
      href="#gpg">an exercise</a> for you to explore this heuristic.  But for
      our YCB objects, I'm not sure it's the best heuristic; we have a lot of
      boxes, and boxes don't have a lot of information to give in their local
      curvature.</p>

      <p>Another heuristic is to find antipodal point pairs in the point cloud,
      and then sample grasp candidates that would align the fingers with those
      antipodal pairs.  Many 3D geometry libraries support "ray casting"
      operations at least for a voxel representation of a point cloud; so a
      reasonable approach to finding antipodal pairs is to simply choose a point
      at random in the point cloud, then ray cast into the point cloud in the
      opposite direction of the normal.  If the normal of the voxel found by ray
      casting is sufficiently antipodal, and if the distance to that voxel is
      smaller than the gripper width, then we've found a reasonable antipodal
      point pair.</p>

      <example id="grasp_sampling"><h1>Generating grasp candidates</h1>

        <p>As an alternative to ray casting, I've implemented an even simpler
        heuristic in my code example: I simply choose a point at random, and
        start sampling grasps in orientation (starting from vertical) that
        align the $x$-axis of the gripper with the normal of that point.  Then
        I mostly just rely on the antipodal term in my scoring function to
        allow me to find good grasps.</p>

        <figure><img style="width:60%"
          src="data/candidate_grasp_mustard.png"></figure>

        <p>I do implement one more heuristic -- once I've found the points in
        the point cloud that are between the finger tips, then I move the hand
        out along the gripper $x$-axis so that those points are centered in the
        gripper frame.  This helps prevent us knocking over objects as we close
        our hands to grasp them.</p>

        <p>But that's it!  It's a very simple strategy.  I sample a handful of
        candidate grasps and just draw the top few with the lowest cost.  If you
        run it a bunch of times, I think you will find it's actually quite
        reasonable.  Every time it runs, it is simulating the objects falling
        from the sky; the actual grasp evaluation is actually quite fast.</p>

  <section><h1>The corner cases</h1>
  
    <p>If you play around with the grasp scoring I've implemented above a little
    bit, you will find deficiencies.  Some of them are addressed easily (albeit
    heuristically) by adding a few more terms to the cost.  For instance, I
    didn't check collisions of the pre-grasp configuration, but this could be
    added easily.</p>

    <p>There are other cases where grasping alone is not sufficient as a
    strategy.  Imagine that you place an object right in one of the corners of
    the bin.  It might not be possible to get the hand around both sides of the
    object without being in collision with either the object or the side.  The
    strategy above will never choose to try to grab the very corner of a box
    (because it always tried to align the sample point normal with the gripper
    $x$), and it's not clear that it should.  This is probably especially true
    for our relatively large gripper.  In the setup we used at TRI, we
    implemented an additional simple "pushing" heuristic that would be used if
    there were point clouds in the sink, but no viable grasp candidate could be
    found.   Instead of grasping, we would drive the hand down and nudge that
    part of the point cloud towards the middle of the bin.  This can actually
    help a lot!
    </p>

    <p>There are other deficiencies to our simple approach that would be very
    hard to address with a purely geometric approach.  Most of them come down to
    the fact that our system so far has no notion of "objects".  For instance,
    it's not uncommon to see this strategy result in "double picks" if two
    objects are close together in the bin.  For heavy objects, it might be
    important to pick up the object close to the center of mass, to improve our
    chances of resisting the gravitational wrench while staying in our friction
    cones.  But our strategy here might pick up a heavy hammer by squeezing just
    the very far end of the handle.</p>

    <p>Interestingly, I don't think the problem is necessarily that the point
    cloud information is insufficient, even without the color information.  I
    could show you similar point clouds and you wouldn't make the same mistake.
    These are the types of examples where learning a grasp metric could
    potentially help.  We don't need to achieve artificial general intelligence
    to solve this one; just experience knowing that when we tried to grasp in
    someplace before we failed would be enough to improve our grasp heuristics
    significantly.</p>

  <section id="task"><h1>Programming the Task Level</h1>

    <p>Most of us are used to writing code in a <a
    href="https://hackr.io/blog/procedural-programming">procedural
    programming</a>
    paradigm; code executes from the top of the program through function calls,
    branchs (like if/then statements), for/while loops, etc. It's tempting to
    to to write our high-level robot programs like that, too.  For the clutter
    task, I could write "while there is an object to pick up in the first bin,
    pick it up and move it to the second bin; ...".  And that is certainly not
    wrong! But to be a component in a robotics framework, this high-level
    program must somehow communicate with the rest of the system at runtime,
    including having interfaces to the low-level controllers that are running
    at some regular frequency (say 100Hz or even 1kHz). So how do we author the
    high-level behaviors (often called "task level") in a way that integrates
    seamlessly with the high-rate low-level controls?</p>

    <p>There are a few important programming paradigms for authoring the
    task-level behavior.  Broadly speaking, I would categorize them into three
    bins:
      <ul>
        <li>Procedural code (in a separate thread) passes messages/events to a
        module that lives in the main robot/simulation thread. This is
        relatively common in a multi-process message-passing ecosystem like
        ROS.</li>
        <li>Task-level "policies" can be authored directly as e.g. finite state
        machines (FSMs) or "behavior trees", which get evaluated directly in
        the robot/simulation loop.</li>
        <li>Task-level "planners" can take rules for how task-level behaviors
        can be chained together to achieve long-term goals:
        <ul>
          <li>In the simplest case, the planner outputs a plan that can be
          executed during the robot/simulation loop, just like the trajectories
          we've used to plan the motion of the gripper.</li>
          <li>If the planner can be run online (e.g. constantly
          adjusting/replanning given new sensor information), then it can be
          used directly in the robot/simulation loop.</li>
          <li> Alternatively, a few planners can actually "compile" their plans
          directly into a policy (e.g. in the form of an FSM). <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_temporal_logic_to_B%C3%BCchi_automaton">Here
          is one of the classic examples</a>.</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    Each of these paradigms has its place, and some researchers heavily favor
    one over the other. I'll always remember Rod Brooks writing papers like
    <u>Elephants Don't Play Chess</u> to argue against task-level
    planning<elib>Brooks90+Brooks91+Brooks91a</elib>. Rod's "subsumption
    architecture" was distinctly in the "task-level policies" category and can
    be seen as a precursor to Behavior Trees; it established its credibility by
    having success on the early Roomba vacuum cleaners. The planning community
    might counter that for truly complicated tasks, it would be impossible for
    human programmers to author a policy for all possible permutations /
    situations that an AI system might encounter; that planning is the approach
    that truly scales. They have addressed some of the initial criticisms about
    symbol grounding and modeling requirements with extensions like planning in
    belief space and task-and-motion planning, which we will cover in later
    parts of the notes. 
    </p>

    <subsection><h1>State Machines and Behavior Trees</h1>
    
    </subsection>

    <subsection><h1>Task planning</h1>

      <p>Task-level planners are based primarily on search. There is a long
      history of AI planning as search. STRIPS <elib>Fikes71</elib> was perhaps
      the earliest, and most famous representation (and algorithm) for
      describing planning problems using an initial state, a goal state, and a
      set of actions with pre-conditions and effects.  Temporal logic (e.g.
      linear temporal logic (LTL), metric temporal logic (MTL), signal temporal
      logic (STL)) enables the specification to include complex goals or
      constraints that evolve over time, such as "event A should eventually
      happen after event B". The planning domain definition language (PDDL)
      <elib>Aeronautiques98+Haslum19</elib> extended the STRIPS representation
      to include more expressive features such as typed variables, conditional
      effects, and (even temporal logic) quantifiers, and served as the
      specification language for a long-running and highly influential series
      of <a href="https://www.icaps-conference.org/competitions/">ICAPS
      planning competitions</a>. These planning competitions gave rise to a
      number of highly effective planning algorithms such as GraphPlan
      <elib>Blum97</elib>, HSP <elib>Bonet01</elib>, Fast-Forward
      <elib>Hoffmann01</elib>, and FastDownward <elib>Helmert06</elib>. These
      planners demonstrated the power of "heurstic search", and strongly
      leverage the object-oriented nature of the specification to use
      factorization as a strong heuristic.</p>

    </subsection>

    <subsection><h1>Large Language Models</h1>

      <p>In late 2022, of course, a new approach to task "planning" exploded
      onto the scene with the rise of large language models (LLMs). It quickly
      became clear that the most powerful language models like GPT4 are capable
      of producing highly nontrivial plans from very limited natural language
      specifications. Careful prompting can be used to guide the LLM to produce
      actions that the robot is is able to perform, and it seems that LLMs are
      particularly good and writing python code. Using Python, it's even
      possible to prompt the LLM to <a
      href="https://code-as-policies.github.io/">generate a policy</a> rather
      than just a plan <elib>Liang23</elib>. At the time of this writing, their
      is still a challenge in automating a depiction of the current environment
      as perceived from the robot cameras/sensors into a natural language
      prompt, but it seems that this is only a matter of time. Word is that the
      rolling release of <a
      href="https://openai.com/research/gpt-4v-system-card">GPT-4V(ision)</a>
      works amazingly well in this capacity.</p>

      <p>An informal consensus is that language models make simple planning
      problems extraordinarily easy. Importantly, while a search-based planner
      might exploit missing requirements / constraints in your specification,
      the LLMs output very reasonable plans, using "common sense" to fill in
      the gaps. There are still limits to what today's LLMs can achieve in the
      way of long-horizon task planning with multi-step reasoning, but clever
      prompt engineering can lead to impressive results <elib>Yao23</elib>.</p>

  <section><h1>Putting it all together</h1>
  
    <p>First, we bundle up our grasp-selection algorithm into a system that
    reads the point clouds from 3 cameras, does the point cloud processing
    (including normal estimation), and the random sampling, and puts the grasp
    selection onto the output port:</p>
    <p text-align="center">
      <script src="htmlbook/js-yaml.min.js"></script>
      <script type="text/javascript">
      var sys = jsyaml.load(`
name: GraspSelector
input_ports:
- cloud0_W
- cloud1_W
- cloud2_W
- body_poses
output_ports:
- grasp_selection (cost, X_WG)`);
      document.write(system_html(sys));
      </script>
    </p> 

    <p>Note that we will instantiate this system twice -- once for the bin
    located on the positive X axis and again for the system on the negative y
    axis.  Thanks to the "pull-architecture" in Drake's systems framework, this
    relatively expensive sampling procedure only gets called when the
    downstream system evaluates the output port.</p>

    <p>The work-horse system in this example is the <code>Planner</code> system
    which implements the basic state machine, calls the planning functions,
    stores the resulting plans in its <code>Context</code>, and evaluates the
    plans on the output port:</p>
    <p text-align="center">
      <script src="htmlbook/js-yaml.min.js"></script>
      <script type="text/javascript">

- reset_diff_ik`);
      document.write(system_html(sys));
      </script>
    </p> 
    <p>This system needs enough input / output ports to get the relevant
    information into the planner, and to command the downstream
    controllers.</p>

            <p>For a given angle $\theta$, what is the minimum coefficient of
            friction required for the box to not slip down the plane? Use $g$
            for acceleration due to gravity.</p>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Now consider a flat ground plane with three solid (uniform density)
        spheres sitting on it, with radius $r$ and mass $m$. Assume they have
        the same coefficient of friction $\mu$ between each other as with the
        ground.</p>

        <p>For each of the following configurations: could the spheres be in
        static equilibrium for some $\mu\in[0,1]$, $m > 0$, $r > 0$? Explain
        why or why not. Remember that both torques and forces need to be
        balanced for all bodies to be in equilibrium.</p>

        <p>To help you solve these problems, we have
        <script>document.write(notebook_link('clutter', notebook='static_equilibrium', link_text = 'a notebook'))</script>
        to help you build intuition and test your answers. It lets you specify
        the configuration of the spheres and then uses the <a
        href="https://drake.mit.edu/doxygen_cxx/classdrake_1_1multibody_1_1_static_equilibrium_problem.html">StaticEquilbriumProblem</a>
        class to solve for static equilibrium. Use this notebook to help
        visualize and think about the system, but for each of the
        configurations, you should have a physical explanation for your answer.
        (An example of such a physical explanation would be a free body diagram
        of the forces and torques on each sphere, and equations for how they
        can or cannot sum to zero. This is essentially what
        StaticEquilbriumProblem checks for.)</p>

    <exercise><h1>Normal Estimation from Depth</h1>

      <p>For this exercise, you will investigate a slightly different approach to normal vector estimation. In particular, we can exploit the spatial structure that is already in a depth image to avoid computing nearest neighbors. You will work exclusively in <script>document.write(notebook_link('clutter', notebook='normal_estimation_depth', link_text='this notebook'))</script>. You will be asked to complete the following steps:</p>
      <ol type="a">
        <li> Implement a method to estimate normal vectors from a depth image,
        without computing nearest neighbors. </li>
        <li> Reason about a scenario where the depth image-based solution will
        not be as performant as computing nearest-neighbors.</li>
      </ol>    
    </exercise>

    <exercise><h1>Analytic Antipodal Grasping</h1>
      <p>So far, we have used sampling-based methods to find antipodal grasps - but can we have find one analytically if we knew the equation of the object shape? For this exercise, you will analyze and implement a correct-by-construction method to find antipodal points using symbolic differentiation and MathematicalProgram. You will work exclusively in <script>document.write(notebook_link('clutter', notebook='analytic_antipodal_grasps', link_text='this notebook'))</script>. You will be asked to complete the following steps:</p>
      <ol type="a">
        <li> Prove that antipodal points are critical points of an energy
        function defined on the shape. </li>
        <li> Prove the converse does not hold.</li>
        <li> Implement a method to find these antipodal points using
        MathematicalProgram.</li>
        <li> Analyze the Hessian of the energy function and its relation to the
        type of antipodal grasps.</li>
      </ol>    
    </exercise>

    <exercise id="gpg"><h1>Grasp Candidate Generation</h1>

      <p>In the chapter notebook, we generated grasp candidates using the
      antipodal heuristic.  In this exercise, we will investigate an
      alternative method for generating grasp candidates based on local
      curvature, similar to the one proposed in <elib>tenPas17</elib>. This
      exercise is implementation-heavy, and you will work exclusively in <script>document.write(notebook_link('clutter', notebook='grasp_candidate', link_text='this notebook'))</script>.</p>
      
    </exercise>    

    <exercise id="behaviorTrees"><h1>Behavior Trees</h1>

      <p>Let's reintroduce the terminology of behavior trees. Behavior trees
      provide a structure for switching between different tasks in a way that
      is both modular and reactive. Behavior trees are a directed rooted tree
      where the internal nodes manage the control flow and the leaf nodes are
      actions to be executed or conditions to be evaluated. For example, an
      action may be to "pick ball". This action can succeed or fail. A
      condition may be "Is my hand empty?" which can be true (thus the
      condition succeeds) or can be false (the condition fails). <br/><br/>

      We'll consider two categories of control flow nodes:
      <dl>
        <dt>Sequence Node: ($\rightarrow$)</dt> <dd>Sequence nodes execute each
        of the child behaviors one after another. The sequence <i>fails if any
        of the children fail</i>. One way to think about this operator is that
        a sequence node takes an "and" over all of the child behaviors.</dd>
        <dt>Fallback Node: (?)</dt> <dd>Fallback nodes also execute each of the
        child behaviors one after another. However, fallback <i>succeeds if any
        of the children succeed</i>. One way to think about this operator is
        that the fallback node takes an "or" over all of the children
        behaviors.</dd>
</dl>

    The symbols are visualized below. Sequence nodes are represented as an
    arrow in a box, fallback nodes are represented as a question mark in a box,
    actions are inside boxes and conditions are inside ovals.</p>
    <figure><img style="width:70%", src="figures/exercises/behaviorTree_symbols.png"/></figure>

    <p>Let's apply our understanding of behavior trees in the context of a
    simple task where a robot's goal is to: find a ball, pick the ball up and
    place the ball in a bin. We can describe task with the high-level behavior
    tree:</p>
    <figure><img style="width:80%", src="figures/exercises/behaviorTree_highLevel.png"/></figure>

    <p>Confirm to yourself that this small behavior tree captures the task! We
    can go one level deeper and expand out our "Pick Ball" behavior:</p>
    <figure><img style="width:80%", src="figures/exercises/behaviorTree_pick.png"/></figure>

    <p>The pick ball behavior can be considered as such: Let's start with the
    left branch. If the ball is already close, the condition "Ball Close?"
    returns true. If the ball is not close, we execute an action to "Approach
    ball", thus making the ball close. Thus either the ball is already close
    (i.e. the condition "Ball Close?" is true) or we approach the ball (i.e.
    the action "Approach ball" is successfully executed) to make the ball
    close. Given that the ball is now close, we consider the right branch of
    the pick action. If the ball is already grasped, the condition "Ball
    Grasped?" returns true. if the ball is not grasped, we execute the action,
    "Grasp Ball".<br/>

    We can expand our our behavior tree even further to give our full
    behavior:</p>
    <figure><img style="width:99%", src="figures/exercises/behaviorTree_detail.png" id="behaviorTree"/>
            <figcaption>Behavior Tree for Pick-Up Task</figcaption></figure>

    <p>Here we've added the behavior that if the robot cannot complete the
    task, it can ask a kind human for help. Take a few minutes to walk through
    the behavior tree and convince yourself it encodes the desired task
    behavior.</p>

    <ol type="a">
        <li> We claimed behavior trees enable reactive behavior. Let's explore
        that. Imagine we have a robot executing our <a
        href="#behaviorTree">behavior tree</a>. As the robot is executing the
        action "Approach Bin", a rude human knocks the ball out of the robot's
        hand. The ball rolls to a position that the robot can still see, but is
        quite far away. Following the logic of the behavior tree, what
        condition fails and what action is executed because of this?</li>

        <li>Another way to mathematically model computation is through finite
        state machines (FSM). Finite state machines are composed of states,
        transitions and events. We can encode the behavior of our behavior tree
        for our pick-up task through a finite state machine, as shown below:


    <figure><img style="width:99%",
    src="figures/exercises/fsm_blanked.png"/></figure>
    We have left a few states and transitions blank. Your task is to fill in
    those 4 values such that the finite state machine produces the same
    behavior as the behavior tree. </li>
    </ol>

    <p>From this simple task we can see that while finite state machines can
    often be easy to understand and intuitive, they can quickly get quite
    messy!</p>

    <ol type="a" start=3> 
        <li> Throughout this chapter and the lectures we've discussed a bin
        picking task. Our goal is to now capture the behavior of the
        bin-picking task using a behavior tree. We want to encode the following
        behavior: while Bin 1 is not empty, we are going to select a feasible
        grasp within the bin, execute our grasp and transport what's within our
        grasp to Bin 2. If there are still objects within Bin 1, but we cannot
        find a feasible grasp, assume we have some action that shakes the bin,
        hence randomizing the objects and (hopefully) making feasible grasps
        available.<br/><br/>

        We define the following conditions:
        <ul>
          <li>"Bin 1 empty?</li>
          <li>"Feasible Grasp Exists?"</li>
          <li>"Grasp selected?"</li>
          <li>"Grasped Object(s) above Bin 2?"</li>
          <li>"Object Grasped?"</li>
          <li>"Object(s) in Bin 2?"</li>
        </ul><br/>
        And the following actions:

        <ul>
          <li>"Drop grasped object(s) into Bin 2"</li>
          <li>"Grasp Object(s)"</li>
          <li>"Select Grasp"</li>
          <li>"Shake Bin"</li>
          <li>"Transport grasped object(s) to above Bin 2"</li>
        </ul><br/>

        Using these conditions, actions and our two control flow nodes
        (Sequence and Fallback), we want you to draw a behavior tree that
        captures the behavior of our bin picking task. To get you started, we
        have included a "rough draft" behavior tree below, but it's broken in a
        number of places (e.g., some branches might be missing, some control
        flow nodes/actions/conditions might have the wrong type, etc.):

        <figure><img style="width:80%",
        src="figures/exercises/behaviorTreeBroken.png"/></figure>

        Your job is to identify all of the places where it's broken, and draw
        your own correct behavior tree with all the broken components fixed. 
        </li>
    </ol>

    <p>We claimed behavior trees are modular. Their modularity comes from the
    fact that we can write reusable snippets of code that define actions and
    conditions and then compose them using behavior trees. For example, we can
    imagine that the "Select Grasp" action from part (c) is implemented using
    the antipodal grasping mechanism we have built up throughout this chapter.
    And the "Transport grasped object(s) to above Bin 2" action could be
    implemented using the pick and place tools we developed in Chapter 3.</p>
