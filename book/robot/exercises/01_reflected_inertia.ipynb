    "You will notice that in the first few weeks of the lecture, we don't think a lot about the full second-order dynamics of the arm (a more complicated version of $F=ma$), although we will come to revisit this later. This problem set helps to understand one of the reasons why we can abstract many manipulation problems kinematically (purely in terms of joint angles and end-effector positions), as opposed to worrying about dynamics (joint torques and inertias). Even before going to the multi-link case, let's think about how we should control the position of a single pendulum.\n",

    "In this problem you will investigate the role of reflected inertia in position control of a simple pendulum. At the end of the notebook, you will be able to check your work in a simulation environment.\n",

    "**These are the main steps of the exercise:**\n",
    "1. Write down the state-space dynamics function for the simple pendulum with motor and gearbox.\n",
