    "In the lecture, we've seen an example of a robot manipulating a cylindrical object in the DARPA Robotics Challenge.  Similarly, by using optimization-based inverse kinematics, we will solve a series of IK problems that can open a cupboard door. You can take a look at the [interactive_ik](https://deepnote.com/workspace/Manipulation-ac8201a1-470a-4c77-afd0-2cc45bc229ff/project/0762b167-402a-4362-9702-7d559f0e73bb/notebook/interactive_ik-b6b0708a94b340b7b17cedbcc3d2d053?secondary-sidebar-autoopen=true&secondary-sidebar=agent) notebook, which illustrates many of the concepts we go through in this notebook.\n",

This trajectory was computed by dividing the motion into following segments:\n",
