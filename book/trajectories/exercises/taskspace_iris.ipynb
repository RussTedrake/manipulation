    "Our goal with IRIS is to form an explicit representation of large convex subsets of the free space (since [new optimization-based planning algorithms](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.11565.pdf) can consume this representation of the free space). Given a seed point (provided by the user) and a small initial ellipse centered at the seed point, IRIS alternates between two steps:\n",
    "1. Find a set of separating hyperplanes which forms a polytope with the ellipsoid on the inside and all of the obstacles on the outside\n",
    "2. Obtain a new maximum volume ellipsoid inscribed within the polytope formed by the current set of hyperplanes. \n",

    "Each of these steps can be completed using an optimization program. Finding the maximum volume ellipse contained inside an intersection of halfspaces can be written as a semidefinite program. Finding a set of hyperplanes that separates each of the obstacles and an ellipse can be broken into a set of steps:\n",
    "- For a given convex obstacle in the workspace, represented as its vertex.\n",
    "- Find the point on the obstacle that is closest to the ellipse. \n",

    "**Note about runtime efficiency**\n",
    "If we repeat this for each obstacle, the intersection of each halfspace formed by the tangent planes we compute are guaranteed to contain the ellipse and none of the obstacles. However, if we perform each step in an environment with many obstacles, we might perform a lot of redundant computation. It is far more efficient if, on each iteration, we check if any of the *other* obstacles also satisfy the constraint of being fully on one side of the hyperplane we compute from the tangent. If this constraint is already satisfied for a hyperplane that's already been computed, we don't have to compute a new one for this obstacle. \n",
