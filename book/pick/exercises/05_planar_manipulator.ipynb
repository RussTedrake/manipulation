For this exercise, you will derive these equations for a simple two-link planar manipulator, using simple geometrical reasoning. As is the case with good toy problems, the two link manipulator has many insights that extend to the multi-link case, despite its apparent simplicity. \n",

In the [monogram notation](https://drake.mit.edu/doxygen_cxx/group__multibody__quantities.html) introduced in the textbook, this means writing down the 2D position of the red point in space with respect to the green frame, ${}^A p^C$, as a function of joint angles $(q_0,q_1)$. \n",
