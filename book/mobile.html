<chapter style="counter-reset: chapter 6"><h1>Mobile Manipulation</h1>

<p>So far we've focused primarily on table-top manipulation. You can bring
many interesting objects / challenges to your robot that is fixed to the table,
and this will continue to keep us busy for many chapters to come. But before we
get too much further, I'd like to stop and ask -- what happens if the robot
also has wheels (or legs!)?</p>

<p>Many of the technical challenges in "mobile manipulation" are the same
challenges we've been discussing for table-top manipulation. But there some
challenges that are new, or at least are more urgent in the mobile setting.
Describing those challenges, and some solutions, is my primary goal for this
chapter.</p>

<p>Most importantly, add mobility to our manipulators can often help us
increase the scope of our ambitions for our robots. Now we can think about
robots moving through houses and accomplishing diverse tasks. It's time to send
our creations out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnTKllDbu5o">to
discover (manipulate?) the world!</a></p>

<section><h1>A New Cast of Characters</h1>



</section>

<section><h1>What's different about perception?</h1>

  <subsection><h1>Partial views / active perception</h1>
  
    <p>We discussed some of the technical challenges that come with having only
    partial views of the objects that you wish to manipulate <a
    href="pose.html#partial_views">in the geometric perception chapter</a>. In
    the table-top manipulation setting, we can typically put cameras looking
    onto the table from all external angles, but our views can still be
    occluded in clutter.</p>

    <p>When you're a mobile robot, we typically don't assume that you can fully
    instrument your environment to the same extent. Typically we try to work
    with only robot-mounted sensors, such as head-mounted cameras. Our <a
    href="clutter.html#antipodal">antipodal grasping strategy</a> won't work
    out of the box if we only see one side of each object.</p>

    <p>The primary solution to this problem is to use machine learning. If you
    only see one half of a mustard bottle, then the instantaneous sensor
    readings simply don't contain enough information to plan a grasp;
    somehow we must infer something about what the back of the object looks
    like (aka "shape completion", though it need not be done explicitly). The
    reason that you would have a good guess at what the back half of the
    mustard bottle looks like is because you've interacted with mustard bottles
    before -- it is the statistics of the objects you've interacted with that
    provides the missing information. So learning isn't just a convenience
    here, it's fundamental. We'll discuss learning-based perception soon!</p>

    <p>There is another mitigation, though, that is often available to a mobile
    manipulator. Now that the cameras (and all of the sensors) are mobile, we
    can actively move them in order to gather information / reduce uncertainty.
    There is a rich literature for "active perception" and "planning under
    uncertainty". [More to come]
    </p>
  
  </subsection>

  <subsection><h1>Unknown (potentially dynamic) environments</h1>

    <p>For table-top manipulation, we started by assuming known objects and
    then discussed approaches (such as antipodal grasping) that could work on
    unknown objects. But throughout that discussion, we always assumed that we
    new the geometry and location of the table / bins! For instance, we
    actively cropped away the point cloud returns that hit the known
    environment and left only points associated with the objects. That's a very
    reasonable thing to do when your robot is bolted to the table, but we need
    to relax that assumption once we go mobile, and start interacting with more
    diverse / less known environments.</p>

    <p>One <i>could</i> try to model everything in the environment. We could do
    object detection to recognize the table, and pose estimation (possibly
    shape estimation) to fit a parametric table model to the observations. But
    that's a difficult road to travel, especially in diverse and expansive
    scenes. Is there an analogy to the antipodal grasping for objects that can
    similarly reduce our need for explicit modeling of the environment?</p>

    <p>We'd like to have a representation of the environment that does not
    require explicit object models, that supports the types of queries we need
    for motion planning (for instance, fast collision detection and
    minimum-distance computations), which we can update efficiently from our
    raw sensor data, and which scale well to large scenes. Raw, merged point
    clouds, for instance, are easy to update and don't require a model, but
    would not be ideal for fast planning queries.</p>

    <p>Voxel grids are a geometry representation that meets (almost all of) the
    our desiderata -- we actually used them already in order to efficiently
    down-sample a point cloud. In this representation we discretize some finite
    volume of 3D space into a grid of fixed-size cubes; let's say 1 cm$^3.$ We
    mark each of these cubes as either occupied or unoccupied (or more
    generally, we can have a probability of being occupied). Then, for
    collision-free motion planning, we treat the occupied cubes as collision
    geometry to be avoided. Many collision queries with voxel grids can be fast
    (and are easily parallelized). In particular the sphere-on-voxel collision
    query can be very fast, which is one of the reasons that you see a number
    of collision geometries in the Drake models that are approximate with
    densely packed spheres. <todo>Figure</todo> Updating a voxel grid with
    points clouds is also efficient. In order to scale voxel representations to
    have both fine resolution and to be able to represent very large scenes, we
    can make use of clever data structures.</p>

    <example><h1>Octomap</h1>
    
      <p>One particularly nice and efficient implementation of voxel grids at
      scale for robotics is an algorithm / software package called Octomap
      <elib>Hornung13</elib>...</p>

      <todo>multi-resolution, efficient collision queries, efficient ray cast, probabilistic updating, including for free space</todo>
    </example>

    <p>Segmenting the visual scene into objects vs environment these days is
    best done with machine learning; we'll implement segmentation pipelines soon.</p>

  </subsection>

  <subsection><h1>Robot state estimation</h1>

    <p>The biggest difference that comes up in perception for a mobile
    manipulator is the need to estimate not only the state of the environment,
    but the state of the robot. For instance, in our point cloud processing
    algorithms so far, we have tacitly assumed that we know ${}^WX^C$, the pose
    of the camera in the world. We could potentially invest in elaborote
    calibration procedures, using known shapes and patterns, in order to
    estimate (offline) these camera extrinsics. We've also take the kinematics
    of the robot to be known -- this is a pretty reasonable assumption when the
    robot is bolted to the table and all of the transforms between the world
    and the end-effector are measured directly with high-accuracy encoders. But
    these assumptions break down once the robot has a mobile base.</p>

    <p>State estimation for mobile robots has a strong history;
    <elib>Thrun05</elib> is the canonical reference. Often these algorithms are
    based on (approximate) recursive Bayesian filtering, or the closely related
    smoothing algorithms <elib>Kaess08</elib>. Typically our mobile bases are
    instrumented with range sensors and/or cameras in addition to the wheel
    encoders and inertial measurement units (IMUs). The state estimation
    pipeline fuses these noisy measurements together into a consistent
    estimate. Indeed, one of the biggest lessons in mobile robots is the wheel
    odometry alone is almost always insufficient for estimation; real wheels
    slip and visual/range measurements provide an essential and independent set
    of measurements.</p>

    <p>Many things have changed since <elib>Thrun05</elib> was written.
    Range-based sensors (lidar and depth cameras) have improved dramatically in
    range, accuracy, and framerate, making the methods dramatically more
    effective.</p> 

    <example><h1>Simulating range sensors in Drake</h1>
    
    </example>
    
    <p>Perhaps the biggest change, though, has been
    the shift from a heavy dependence on range-based sensors / depth-cameras
    towards increasingly powerful estimation algorithm which use only RGB
    cameras. This is due to advances in visual-inertial
    odometry<elib>Scaramuzza11</elib>, monocular depth
    estimation<elib>Ming21</elib>, and dense 3D reconstruction / structure from
    motion<elib>Mildenhall21+Kerbl23</elib>, to name a few.</p>
  </subsection>

</section>

<section><h1>What's different about motion planning?</h1>

  <p>Let's start with an example of perhaps the simplest (given our toolbox so
  far) to build ourselves a mobile manipulator.</p>

  <example><h1>iiwa on a prismatic base</h1>
  
    <p>Let's take the iiwa model and add a few degrees of freedom to the base.
    Rather than welding link 0 to the world, let's insert three prismatic
    joints (connected by invisible, massless links) corresponding to motion in
    $x$, $y$, and $z$. I'll allow $x$ and $y$ to be unbounded, but will set
    modest joint limits on $z$. The first joint of the iiwa already rotates
    around the base $z$ axis; I'll just remove the joint limits so that it can
    rotate continuously. Simple changes, and now I have the essence of a mobile
    robot.</p>

    <p>Code coming soon...</p>

  </example>

  <p>Now let's ask: how do I have to change my motion planning tools to work
  with this version of the iiwa? The answer is: not much! Our motion planning
  tools were all quite general, and work with basically any kinematic robot
  configuration. The mobile base that we've added here just adds a few more
  joints to that kinematic tree, but otherwise fits directly into the
  framework.</p>

  <p>One possible consideration is that we have increased the number of degrees
  of freedom (here from 7 to 10). Trajectory optimization algorithms, by
  virtue(?) of being local to a trajectory, scale easily to high-dimensional
  problems, so this is no problem. Sampling-based planners struggle more with
  dimension, but RRTs should be fine in 10 dimensions. PRMs can definitely work
  in 10 dimensions, too, but probably require an efficient implementation and
  are starting to reach their limits.</p>

  <p>Another consideration which may be new for the mobile base is the
  existence of a continuous joint (rotations around the $z$ axis do not have
  joint limits). These can require some care in the planning stack. In a
  sampling-based planner, typically the distance metric and extend operations
  are adapted to consider edges that can wrap around $2\pi$. Nonconvex
  trajectory optimization doesn't require algorithmic modifications, per se,
  but does potentially suffer from local minima. For <a
  href="trajectories.html#gcs">trajectory optimization with Graphs of Convex
  Sets</a>, one simply needs to take care that the IRIS regions operate in a
  local coordinate system and don't have a domain wider than $\pi$ in any
  wrapping joint<elib>Cohn23</elib>. Failure to address this properly can
  result in slightly absurd plans which take the long way around; <a
  href="https://ggcs-anonymous-submission.github.io/meshcat/1CL-4CR/trajopt.html">here's
  an example</a> of kinematic trajectory optimization finding a suboptimal
  solution to navigating between the shelves, from <elib>Cohn23</elib>.</p>

  <p>What happens if instead of implementing the mobile manipulator using
  prismatic joints, we're going to use wheels or legs? As we'll see, some
  wheeled robots (and most legged robots) can provide our prismatic joints
  abstraction directly, but others add constraints that we must consider during
  motion planning.</p>

  <subsection><h1>Wheeled robots</h1>

    <p>Even though real wheels do slip, we typically do motion planning with
    the no-slip assumption, then use feedback control to follow the planned
    path <elib part="Ch. 49">Siciliano16</elib>.</p>

    </subsubsection>

  </subsection>

  <subsection><h1>Legged robots</h1>
      
    <p>If your job is to do the planning and control for the legs of a robot,
    then there is a <a href="https://underactuated.mit.edu">rich literature for
    you to explore</a>. But if you are using a legged robot like <a
    href="https://bostondynamics.com/products/spot/">Spot</a> to perform mobile
    manipulation, and you're using the API provided by Boston Dynamics, then
    (fortunately or unfortunately) you don't get to dive into the low-level
    control of the legs. In fact, Spot provides an API that to first order
    treats the legged platform as a holonomic base. (There are secondary
    considerations, like the fact that the robots center of mass is limited by
    dynamic constraints, and may deviate from your requested trajectory in
    order to maintain balance).</p>

    <example><h1>Mobile manipulation with Spot</h1>
    
    </example>

    <p>Of course, things get much more interesting when you are performing
    mobile manipulation on rough or intermitted terrain; this is where the
    legged platform really shines!</p>

  </subsection>

</section>

<section><h1>What's different about simulation?</h1>

  <p>Mobile manipulation encourages us to expand the scope of our simulation,
  in addition to our autonomy algorithms. Rather than simulating a few objects
  on a table top, now we start asking about simulating the robot in a more
  expansive environment.</p>

  <p>When I've used the term "simulation" so far in these notes, I've been
  focusing mostly on the enabling technologies, like the physics engine and the
  the rendering engine. In robotics today, there are only a handful of
  mainstream simulators which people are using, such as NVidia Isaac/Omniverse,
  MuJoCo, and Drake. (PyBullet was very popular but is no longer
  actively maintained.) But there is another crop of tools which call
  themselves "simulators" that build upon these engines (and/or more
  traditional engines from computer games like Unity or Unreal) and offer
  higher-level abstractions. I think of these as content aggregators, and feel
  that they serve a very important role.</p>

  <example><h1>Sapien</h1></example>
  <example><h1>Behavior 1K</h1></example>
  <example><h1>Habitat 3.0</h1></example>
  <!--<example><h1>ThreeDWorld</h1></example>-->

  <p>For my part, I hope that the problems specifications and assets from these
  tools can be imported easily enough into Drake that we can use not only our
  simulation engine, but also our perception, planning, and control tools to
  solve them. We are gradually building out or support for loading from other
  formats, or translating from other formats in order to facilitate this.</p>

</section>

<section><h1>Navigation</h1>

  <p>Most of the ideas we've covered in this chapter so far can be considered
  relatively modest extensions to our existing manipulation toolbox. But there
  are some important problem associated with navigating a mobile robot that
  really don't come up in table-top manipulation.</p>

<section><h1>Exercises</h1>
  <exercise><h1>Adding Object Models</h1>
    <p> For this exercise, you will load custom objects into a simulation.
    You will work exclusively in <script>document.write(notebook_link('mobile', notebook='adding_models', link_text='this notebook'))</script>. You will be asked to complete the following steps: </p>
    <ol type="a">
      <li> Analyze the collision geometry of pre-defined SDF files. </li>
      <li> Import your own object file into the simulation. </li>
    </ol>
  </exercise>    

  <exercise><h1>Mobile Base Inverse Kinematics</h1>
    <p> For this exercise, you will implement an inverse kinematics optimization for a manipulator with both a fixed and mobile base.
    By removing position constraints on the base of our robot, we can solve the optimization much more easily.
    You will work exclusively in <script>document.write(notebook_link('mobile', notebook='mobile_base_ik', link_text='this notebook'))</script>.</p>
