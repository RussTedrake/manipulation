<chapter style="counter-reset: chapter 8"><h1>Object Detection and
Segmentation</h1>

  <p>Our study of geometric perception gave us good tools for estimating the
  pose of a known object.  These algorithms can produce highly accurate
  estimates, but are still subject to local minima.  When the scenes get more
  cluttered/complicated, or if we are dealing with many different object types,
  they really don't offer an adequate solution by themselves.</p>

  <p>Deep learning has given us data-driven solutions that complement our
  geometric approaches beautifully.  Finding correlations in massive datasets
  has proven to be a fantastic way to provide practical solutions to these more
  "global" problems like detecting whether the mustard bottle is even in the
  scene, segmenting out the portion of the image / point cloud that is relevant
  to the object, and even in providing a rough estimate of the pose that could
  be refined with a geometric method.</p>

  <p>There are many sources of information about deep learning on the internet,
  and I have no ambition of replicating nor replacing them here.  But this
  chapter does being our exploration of deep perception in manipulation, and I
  feel that I need to give just a little context.</p>

  <section><h1>Getting to big data</h1>

    <subsection><h1>Crowd-sourced annotation datasets</h1>
    
      <p>The modern revolution in computer vision was unquestionably fueled by
      the availability of massive annotated datasets.  The most famous of all is
      ImageNet, which eclipsed previous datasets with the number of images and
      the accuracy and usefulness of the labels<elib>Russakovsky15</elib>.
      Fei-fei Li, who led the creation of ImageNet has been giving talks that
      give some nice historical perspective on how ImageNet came to be.  
      <a href="https://youtu.be/0bb9EcaQupI">Here is one</a> (slightly) tailored
      to robotics and even manipulation; you might start <a
      href="https://youtu.be/0bb9EcaQupI?t=857">here</a>.  </p>

      <p><elib>Russakovsky15</elib> describes the annotations available in
      ImageNet: <blockquote>... annotations fall into one of two categories: (1)
      image-level annotation of a binary label for the presence or absence of an
      object class in the image, e.g., "there are cars in this image" but "there
      are no tigers," and (2) object-level annotation of a tight bounding box
      and class label around an object instance in the image, e.g., "there is a
      screwdriver centered at position (20,25) with width of 50 pixels and
      height of 30 pixels".</blockquote></p>

      <figure><img width="80%"
      src="data/coco_instance_segmentation.jpeg"/><figcaption>A sample annotated
      image from the COCO dataset, illustrating the difference between
      image-level annotations, object-level annotations, and segmentations at
      the class/semantic- or instance- level..</figcaption></figure>

      <p>In practice, ImageNet enabled object detection.  The COCO dataset
      similarly enabled pixel-wise <i>instance-level</i>
      segmentation <elib>Lin14a</elib>, where distinct instances of a class are
      given a unique label (and also associated with the class label).  COCO has
      fewer object categories than ImageNet, but more instances per category.
      It's still shocking to me that they were able to get 2.5 million images
      labeled at the pixel level.  I remember some of the early projects at MIT
      when crowd-sourced image labeling was just beginning (projects like
      LabelMe <elib>Russell08</elib>);  Antonio Torralba used to joke about how
      surprised he was about the accuracy of the (nearly) pixel-wise annotations
      that he was able to crowd-source (and that his mother was a particularly
      prolific and accurate labeler)!</p>

      <p>Instance segmentation turns out to be an very good match for the
      perception needs we have in manipulation.  In the last chapter we found
      ourselves with a bin full of YCB objects.  If we want to pick out only the
      mustard bottles, and pick them out one at a time, then we can use a deep
      network to perform an initial instance-level segmentation of the scene,
      and then use our grasping strategies on only the segmented point cloud.
      Or if we do need to estimate the pose of an object (e.g. in order to place
      it in a desired pose), then segmenting the point cloud can also
      dramatically improve the chances of success with our geometric pose
      estimation algorithms.</p>

    </subsection>

    <subsection><h1>Segmenting new classes via fine tuning</h1>

      <p>The ImageNet and COCO datasets contain labels for <a
      href="https://tech.amikelive.com/node-718/what-object-categories-labels-are-in-coco-dataset/">a
      variety of interesting classes</a>, including cows, elephants, bears,
      zebras and giraffes.  They have a few classes that are more relevant to
      manipulation (e.g., plates, forks, knives, and spoons), but they don't
      have a mustard bottle nor a can of potted meat like we have in the YCB
      dataset.  So what are we do to?  Must we produce the same image annotation
      tools and pay for people to label thousands of images for us?</p>

      <p>One of the most amazing and magical properties of the deep
      architectures that have been working so well for instance-level
      segmentation is their ability to transfer to new tasks ("transfer
      learning").  A network that was pre-trained on a large dataset like
      ImageNet or COCO can be fine-tuned with a relatively much smaller amount
      of labeled data to a new set of classes that are relevant to our
      particular application.  In fact, the architectures are often referred to
      as having a "backbone" and a "head" -- in order to train a new set of
      classes, it is often possible to just pop off the existing head and
      replace it with a new head for the new labels.  A relatively small amount
      of training with a relatively small dataset can still achieve
      surprisingly robust performance.  Moreover, it seems that training
      initially on the diverse dataset (ImageNet or COCO) is actually important
      to learn the robust perceptual representations that work for a broad
      class of perception tasks.  Incredible!</p>

      <p>This is great news!  But we still need some amount of labeled data for
      our objects of interest.  The last few years have seen a number of
      start-ups based purely on the business model of helping you get your
      dataset labeled.  But thankfully, this isn't our only option.
      </p>
    
    </subsection>

    <subsection><h1>Annotation tools for manipulation</h1>
    
      <p>Just as projects like LabelMe helped to streamline the process of
      providing pixel-wise annotations for images downloaded from the web,
      there are a number of tools that have been developed to streamline the
      annotation process for robotics.  One of the earliest examples was
      <a href="http://labelfusion.csail.mit.edu/">LabelFusion</a>, which combines geometric perception of point clouds
      with a simple user interface to very rapidly label a large number of
      images<elib>Marion17</elib>.</p>

      <figure><img id="labelfusion" style="width:75%" src="data/labelfusion_multi_object_scenes.png" onmouseenter="this.src = 'https://github.com/RobotLocomotion/LabelFusion/raw/master/docs/fusion_short.gif'" onmouseleave="this.src = 'data/labelfusion_multi_object_scenes.png'"/>
        <figcaption>A multi-object scene from <a
        href="http://labelfusion.csail.mit.edu/">LabelFusion</a>
        <elib>Marion17</elib>.  (Mouse over for animation)</figcaption>
      </figure>
      
      <p>In LabelFusion, the user provides multiple RGB-D images of a static
      scene containing some objects of interest, and the CAD models for those
      objects. LabelFusion uses a dense reconstruction algorithm,
      ElasticFusion<elib>Whelan16</elib>, to merge the point clouds from the
      individual images into a single dense reconstruction; this is just
      another instance of the point cloud registration problem.  The dense
      reconstruction algorithm also localizes the camera relative to the point
      cloud.  To localize a particlar object, like the drill in the image
      above, LabelFusion provides a simple gui that asks the user to click on
      three points on the model and three points in the scene to establish the
      "global" correspondence, and then runs ICP to refine the pose estimate.
      In addition to this one registration providing labeled poses in
      <i>all</i> of the original images, the pixels from the CAD model can be
      "rendered" on top of all of the images in the established pose giving
      beautiful pixel-wise labels.</p>

      <p>Tools like LabelFusion can be use to label large numbers of images very
      quickly (three clicks from a user produces ground truth labels in many
      images).</p>
    
    </subsection>

    <subsection><h1>Synthetic datasets</h1>
    
      <p>All of this real world data is incredibly valuable.  But we have
      another super powerful tool at our disposal: simulation!  Computer vision
      researchers have traditionally been very skeptical of training perception
      systems on synthetic images, but as game-engine quality physics-based
      rendering has become a commodity technology, roboticists have been using
      it aggressively to supplement or even replace their real-world datasets.
      The annual robotics conferences now feature regular <a
      href="https://sim2real.github.io/">workshops and/or debates</a> on the
      topic of "sim2real".  For any specific scene or narrow class of objects,
      we can typically generate accurate enough art assets (with material
      properties that are often still tuned by an artist) and environment maps
      / lighting conditions that rendered images can be highly effective in a
      training dataset.  The bigger question is whether we can generate a
      <i>diverse</i> enough set of data with distributions representative of
      the real world to train robust feature detectors in the way that we've
      managed to train with ImageNet.  But for many serious robotics groups,
      synthetic data generation pipelines have significantly augmented or even
      replaced real-world labeled data.</p>

      <p>There is a subtle reason for this. Human annotations on real data,
      although they can be quite good, are never perfect. Labeling errors can
      put a ceiling on the total performance achievable by the learning
      system<elib>Northcutt21</elib>. Even if we admit the gap between rendered
      images and natural images, at some point the ability to generate
      arbitrarily large datasets with perfect pixel-wise labels actually
      enables training on synthetic datasets to be more surpass the performance
      for training on real data even when evaluated on real-world test sets.
      </p>
    
      <p>For the purposes of this chapter, I aim to train an instance-level
      segmentation system that will work well on our simulated images.  For
      this use case, there is (almost) no debate!  Leveraging the pre-trained
      backbone from COCO, I will use only synthetic data for fine tuning.</p>

      <p>You may have noticed it already, but the <code>RgbdSensor</code> that we've been using in Drake actually has a "label image" output port that we haven't used yet.</p>

      <div>
        <script type="text/javascript">
        var rgdbsensor = { "name": "RgbdSensor", 
          "input_ports" : ["geometry_query"],
          "output_ports" : ["color_image", "depth_image_32f", "depth_image_16u", "<b>label_image</b>", "X_WB"]
          };
        document.write(system_html(rgdbsensor, "https://drake.mit.edu/doxygen_cxx/classdrake_1_1systems_1_1sensors_1_1_rgbd_sensor.html"));
        </script>
      </div>
      
      <p>This output port exists precisely to support the perception training
      use case we have here.  It outputs an image that is identical to the RGB
      image, except that every pixel is "colored" with a unique instance-level
      identifier.</p>

      <figure><img style="width:100%" src="data/clutter_maskrcnn_labels.png"/>
      <figcaption>Pixelwise instance segmentation labels provided by the "label
      image" output port from <code>RgbdSensor</code>.  I've remapped the colors
      to be more visually distinct.</figcaption> </figure>

      <example><h1>Generating training data for instance segmentation</h1>
      
        <p>I've provided a simple script that runs our "clutter generator" from
        our bin picking example that drops random YCB objects into the bin.
        After a short simulation, I render the RGB image and the label image,
        and save them (along with some metadata with the instance and class
        identifiers) to disk.</p>

        <p>I've verified that this code <i>can</i> run on Colab, but to make a
        dataset of 10k images using this un-optimized process takes about an
        hour on my big development desktop. And curating the files is just
        easier if you run it locally.  So I've provided this one as a python
        script instead.</p>

        <pysrc no_colab=True>segmentation/segmentation_data.py</pysrc>
      
        <todo>Provide a colab version?</todo>

        <p>You can also feel free to skip this step!  I've uploaded the 10k
        images that I generated <a
        href="https://groups.csail.mit.edu/locomotion/clutter_maskrcnn_data.zip">here</a>.
        We'll download that directly in our training notebook.</p>

    <subsection><h1>Self-supervised learning</h1></subsection>

    <subsection><h1>Even bigger datasets</h1>
    
      <p>With the rise of large language models (LLMs) came a very natural
      question: how do we obtain a "foundation model" for computer vision? This
      would be loosely defined as a model that had impressive zero-shot
      prediction performance on basically any new image, without prompting and
      a small number of interactions with a non-expert user replacing the need
      for fine-tuning on a domain-specific dataset.</p>

      <p>Segment Anything <elib>Kirillov23</elib> came out earlier in 2023; it
      is a foundation model for segmentation tasks. The associated dataset,
      SA-1B, is dramatically larger that pre-existing datasets like COCO in
      terms of the number of images,the resolution of the images, and the
      number of labeled segmentations. It's enormous scale was enabled by a
      "data-engine" which used increasingly powerful versions of the Segment
      Anything models to provide initial segmentation labels; this output was
      then passed to expert paid image labelers who could adjust/correct the
      labels and add labels for increasingly obscure parts of the image that
      the model had missed. Perhaps fine-tuning on our robot-specific datasets
      is, or will soon be, a thing of the past.</p>

    </subsection>

  </section>

  <section><h1>Object detection and segmentation</h1>
  
    <p>There is a lot to know about modern object detection and segmentation
    pipelines.  I'll stick to the very basics.</p>
    
    <!-- nice overview slides at
    http://cs231n.stanford.edu/slides/2020/lecture_12.pdf .  Videos at
    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vT1JzLTH4G4&list=PL3FW7Lu3i5JvHM8ljYj-zLfQRF3EO8sYv&index=1
    -->

    <p>For image recognition (see Figure 1), one can imagine training a standard
    convolutional network that takes the entire image as an input, and outputs a
    probability of the image containing a sheep, a dog, etc.  In fact, these
    architectures can even work well for semantic segmentation, where the input
    is an image and the output is another image; a famous architecture for this
    is the Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) <elib>Long15</elib>.  But for
    object detection and instance segmentation, even the number of outputs of
    the network can change.  How do we train a network to output a variable
    number of detections?</p>

    <p>The mainstream approach to this is to first break the input image up into
    many (let's say on the order of 1000) overlapping regions that might
    represent interesting sub-images.  Then we can run our favorite image
    recognition and/or segmentation network on each subimage individually, and
    output a detection for each region that that is scored as having a high
    probability.  In order to output a tight bounding box, the detection
    networks are also trained to output a "bounding box refinement" that selects
    a subset of the final region for the bounding box.  Originally, these region
    proposals were done with more traditional image preprocessing algorithms, as
    in R-CNN (Regions with CNN Features)<elib>Girshick14</elib>.  But the "Fast"
    and "Faster" versions of R-CNN replaced even these preprocessing with
    learned "region proposal networks"<elib>Girshick15+Ren15</elib>.</p>

    <p>For instance segmentation, we will use the very popular Mask R-CNN
    network which puts all of these ideas, using region proposal networks and a
    fully convolutional networks for the object detection and for the masks
    <elib>He17</elib>.  In Mask R-CNN, the masks are evaluated in parallel from
    the object detections, and only the masks corresponding to the most likely
    detections are actually returned.  At the time of this writing, the latest
    and most performant implementation of Mask R-CNN is available in the <a
    href="https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2">Detectron2</a>
    project from Facebook AI Research.  But that version is not quite as
    user-friendly and clean as the original version that was released in the
    PyTorch <a
    href="https://pytorch.org/vision/stable/index.html"><code>torchvision</code></a>
    package; we'll stick to the <code>torchvision</code> version for our
    experiments here.</p>

    <example><h1>Fine-tuning Mask R-CNN for bin picking</h1>

      <p>The following notebook loads our 10k image dataset and a Mask R-CNN
      network pre-trained on the COCO dataset.  It then replaces the head of the
      pre-trained network with a new head with the right number of outputs for
      our YCB recognition task, and then runs just a 10 epochs of training with
      my new dataset.</p>

      In Colab"/></a> (Training Notebook)
      </p>
    
      <p>Training a network this big (it will take about 150MB on disk) is not
      fast.  I strongly recommend hitting play on the cell immediately after the
      training cell while you are watching it train so that the weights are
      saved and downloaded even if your Colab session closes.  But when you're
      done, you should have a shiny new network for instance segmentation of the
      YCB objects in the bin!</p>

      <p>I've provided a second notebook that you can use to load and evaluate
      the trained model.  If you don't want to wait for your own to train, you
      can examine the one that I've trained!</p>

    <exercise><h1>Segmentation + Antipodal Grasping</h1>

      <p> For this exercise, you will use Mask-RCNN and our previously
      developed antipodal grasp strategy to select a grasp given a point cloud.
      You will work exclusively in <script>document.write(notebook_link('segmentation', notebook='segmentation_and_grasp', link_text='this notebook'))</script>. You will be asked to complete the
      following steps: </p>

      <ol type="a">
        <li> Automatically filter the point cloud for points that correspond to
        our intended grasped object</li>
        <li> Analyze the impact of a multi-camera setup.</li>
        <li> Consider why filtering the point clouds is a useful step in this
        grasping pipeline.</li>
        <li> Discuss how we could improve this grasping pipeline. </li>
      </ol>
