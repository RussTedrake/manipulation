    "## Grasp Sampling Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "That was a lot of subcomponents, but we're finally onto the grand assembly. You will now generate `candidate_num` candidate grasps using everything we have written so far. The sampling algorithm goes as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Select a random point $p$ from the pointcloud (use `np.random.randint()`)\n",
    "2. Compute the Darboux frame ${}^WX^F(p)$ of the point $p$ using `compute_darboux_frame`. \n",
    "3. Randomly sample an $x$ direction translation $x\\in[x_{min},x_{max}]$, and a $z$ direction rotation $\\phi\\in[\\phi_{min},\\phi_{max}]$. Compute a grasp frame $T$ that has the relative transformation `X_FT=(RotateZ(phi),TranslateX(x))`. Convince yourself this makes the point $p$ stay in the \"closing plane\" (drawn in red) defined in the figure above. (NOTE: For ease of grading, make sure you compute the $x$ direction first with `np.random.rand()`, then compute the $\\phi$ direction with another call to `np.random.rand()`, not the other way around.) \n",
    "4. From the grasp frame $T$, translate along the $y$ axis such that the gripper is closest to the object without collision. Use `find_minimum_distance`, and call this frame $G$. Remember that `find_minimum_distance` can return `np.nan`. Skip the loop if this happens. \n",
    "5. If $G$ results in no collisions (see `check_collision`) and results in non-empty grasp (use `check_nonempty`), append it to the candidate list. If not, continue the loop until we have desired number of candidates. \n"
