    "## Intro\n",
    "In this notebook, you will be working on implementing the loss for [dense object net](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.08756).\n",
    "\n",
    "When doing robotic manipulation with perception, we sometimes need to find pixel correspondences between two images. For example, we have an image of a mug that we've pre-computed optimal contact position on the handle. We know the pixel that correspond to the contact position in this source image. Now, given an image of a cluttered scene containing the mug, we want to identify the pixel that correspond to the same contact position on handle in order to transfer the grasp to the new scene.\n",

    "<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"https://iili.io/tSulS4.png\" width=\"500\"></p>\n",
    "\n",
    "In reality, we don't want to train one correspondence model for every single possible interested point on the object. Instead, we hope to train one model that can help us establish correspondence for arbitary points on the object, such as handle, joint, a point on lid etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve this, we use convolution neural network to parameterize a dense descriptor $f$. Given an image $I$ of shape HxWxD, $f$ takes in $I$ and outputs a D-dimensional feature vector at every pixel. That is, $f(I) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{H\\times W\\times D}$. We can now specify an index $(i, j)$ in 2d image frame, the feature vector $f(I)[i,j]$ 'describes' the sematic meaning of pixel $I[i,j]$. Intuitively, if the feature at two pixel locations are similiar, we should get a similiar descriptor vector. Notice $f$ is a fully convolutional neural network, so $f(I)[i,j]$ depends on not just pixel $I[i,j]$ but also its neighborhood.\n",
    "\n",
    "We now offer a (loose) mathematical formulation of 'describes':\n",
    "Given two images, $I_a, I_b$ and a pair of coordinates, $(u_a, v_a)$ and $(u_b, v_b)$, if the pixel $I_a[i_a, j_a]$ and $I_b[i_b, j_b]$ correspond to the same point on the object (e.g tip of a pencil), we hope $|| f(I_a)[i_a, j_a], f(I_b)[i_b, j_b]||_2$ is as small as possible. If they correspond to distinct points on the object (e.g. pencil tip and rubber), $|| f(I_a)[i_a, j_a], f(I_b)[i_b, j_b]||_2$ should be as big as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we project the D-dimensional features at each pixel location to 3-dim RGB space, we can see correponding pairs will share the same color.\n",

    "## a) Loss Implementation\n",
    "In the code block below, you are asked to implement the loss in Dense Object Net (DON). Read section 3.1 of the [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.08756.pdf) and fill out the following function. In DON paper, $u$ instead of $(i, j)$ is used as the notation for index in camera plane. The variable u in the code block uses the definition from the DON paper.\n",
    "\n",
    "By deep learning convention, you are not allowed to use any kind of loops in the function to make your code fast to compute.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: In deep learning, the data always come in batches. So a batch of indices u will have shape (N, 2) for batch size. Usually images come in batch too, but in DON we are sampling a large batch size of indices for every image, therefore input images are not batched here.\n"
