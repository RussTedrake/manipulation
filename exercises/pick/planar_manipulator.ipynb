    "In the lecture, we learned about forward and differential inverse kinematics. For this exercise, you will derive these equations for a simple two-link planar manipulatorm, using simple geometrical reasoning. As is the case with good toy problems, the two link manipulator has many insights that extend to the multi-link case, despite its apparent simplicity. \n",
