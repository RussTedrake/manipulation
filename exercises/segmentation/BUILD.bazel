# TODO(russt):
# Add test coverage for segmentation_and_grasp.ipynb

# Note: We ended up not releasing the segmentation_and_grasp.ipynb on the pset
# because the grader gave different results on different platforms (and likely
# would get zero on the autograder).  We'll need to clean that up before using
# this problem in the future.
