    "# Generate Mask Labels\n",
    "\n",
    "In the lecture, you have learned about Mask-RCNN. A major difficulty in training/fine-tuning Mask-RCNN is to obtain high-quality real training data, especially the mask labels for the objects of interest. Although you can get training labels from [Amazon Mechanical Turk](https://www.mturk.com/), it is a paid service and you will have to wait for some time until you get your data labeled. An alternative method is to design clever pipelines to generate labeled masks automatically without requiring manual labor.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a setup where an object of interest is placed on a planar surface, and an RGBD camera is mounted at a fixed location pointing to the object. From the RGBD camera, you should be able to generate the corresponding point clouds of the desired object and the surrounding environment (e.g. planar surface). You can easily remove the points associated with the planar surface (recall RANSAC exercise in the problem set 2). The remaining points then should all belong to the desired object. To generate mask labels, all you need to do is to project the points back to the camera image plane using the pinhole camera model!\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's quickly review the pinhole camera model!\n",
    "\n",
    "In the last problem set, you have played with [pinhole camera model](https://docs.opencv.org/3.4/d9/d0c/group__calib3d.html). In particular, you used the pinhole camera model to map the depth pixels to 3D points. You may review the `SimpleCameraSystem` class from the last problem set.\n",
    "\n",
    "The mathematical description of the pinhole camera model is written below (you may also use the intrinsics matrix by `env.cam_info.intrinsic_matrix()`).\n",
    "\n",
    "The camera intrinsics are:\n",
    "$$X_c = (u-c_x)\\frac{Z_c}{f_x}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Y_c = (v-c_y)\\frac{Z_c}{f_y}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Notations:\n",
    "- $f_x$: focal length in x direction\n",
    "- $f_y$: focal length in y direction\n",
    "- $c_x$: principal point in x direction (pixels)\n",
    "- $c_y$: principal point in y direction (pixels)\n",
    "- $(X_C, Y_C, Z_C)$: points in camera frame\n",
    "\n",
    "where $f_x$, $f_y$, $c_x$, $c_y$ specify the intrinsics of the camera.\n",
    "\n",
    "The diagram of the pinhole camera model below is found from [OpenCV documentation](https://docs.opencv.org/3.4/d9/d0c/group__calib3d.html). Note that the $u$ and $v$ directions are reversed in Python due to the difference in the convention."
