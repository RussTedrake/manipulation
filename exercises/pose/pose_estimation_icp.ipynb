    "Before jumping into the main exercise, how should we computationally represent a pointcloud? If we say that pointcloud has $N$ points, then each point has a position in 3D, ${}^Cp^i$, as well as an associated color. Throughout this exercise, we will tend to store them as separate arrays of:\n",
    "- `Nx3` numpy array where each row stores the XYZ position of the point in meters.\n",
    "- `Nx3` numpy array where each row stores the RGB information of the point in `uint8` format. \n",

    "But many opensource libraries have their own implementations of the `PointCloud` class, mainly because they have highly optimized the underlying operations that take place under the hood, usually at the `C/C++`-level. [Drake](https://drake.mit.edu/) has a [PointCloud](https://drake.mit.edu/pydrake/pydrake.perception.html#pydrake.perception.PointCloud) class, and [Open3d](http://www.open3d.org/) has its own [PointCloud](http://www.open3d.org/docs/release/python_api/open3d.geometry.PointCloud.html) class.
