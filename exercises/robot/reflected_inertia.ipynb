This problem set helps to understand one of the reasons why we can abstract many manipulation problems kinematically (purely in terms of joint angles and end-effector positions), as opposed to worrying about dynamics (joint torques and inertias). Even before going to the multi-link case, let's think about how we should control the position of a single pendulum. \n",
