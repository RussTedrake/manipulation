These files are the result of reconstructing a set of range images
using the "zipper" program.  The first file is the high resolution
result, while the "_res*" files are decimated versions.  Note that
these decimations were performed using a crude algorithm that does not
necessarily preserve mesh topology.  While they are not beautiful,
they are suitable for interactive rendering.
