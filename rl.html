<chapter style="counter-reset: chapter 8"><h1>Reinforcement Learning</h1>
  <div style="clear:right;"></div>

  <p>These days, there is a lot of excitement around reinforcement learning
  (RL), and a lot of literature available.  The scope of what one might
  consider to be a reinforcement learning algorithm has also broaden
  significantly. The classic (and now updated) and still best introduction to
  RL is the book by Sutton and Barto <elib>Sutton18</elib> .  For a more
  theoretical view, try <elib>Agarwal20b+Szepesvari10</elib>.  There
  are some great online courses, as well: <a
  href="http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs234/">Stanford CS234</a>, <a
  href="https://rail.eecs.berkeley.edu/deeprlcourse/">Berkeley CS285</a>, <a
  href="https://deepmind.com/learning-resources/-introduction-reinforcement-learning-david-silver">DeepMind
  x UCL</a>.</p>

  <p>My goal for this chapter is to provide enough of the fundamentals to get
  us all on the same page, but to focus primarily on the RL ideas (and
  examples) that are particularly relevant for manipulation.  And manipulation
  is a great playground for RL, due to the need for rich perception, for
  operating in diverse environments, and potentially with rich contact
  mechanics.  Many of the core applied research results have been motivated by
  and demonstrated on manipulation examples!</p>

  <section><h1>RL Software</h1>
  
    <p>There are now a huge variety of RL toolboxes available online, with
    widely varying levels of quality and sophistication.  But there is one
    standard that has clearly won out as the default interface with which one
    should wrap up their simulator in order to connect to a variety of RL
    algorithms: the <a href="https://www.gymlibrary.ml/">Gym</a>.</p>

    <p>It's worth taking a minute to appreciate the difference in the OpenAI
    Gym <a href="https://www.gymlibrary.ml/">Environments</a>
    (<code>gym.Env</code>) interface and the Drake System interface; I think it
    is very telling.  My goal (in Drake), is to present you with a rich and
    beautiful interface to express and optimize dynamical systems, to expose
    and exploit all possible structure in the governing equations.  The goal in
    Gym is to expose the absolute minimal details, so that it's possible to
    easily wrap every possible system under the same common interface (it doesn't matter if it's a robot, an Atari game, or
    even a <a href="https://github.com/facebookresearch/CompilerGym">compiler</a>). Almost
    by definition, you can wrap any Drake system as a Gym Environment; I have
    examples of how to do it correctly <a
    href="https://github.com/RobotLocomotion/drake/issues/15508">here</a>.  You
    can also use any Gym environment in the Drake ecosystem; you just won't be
    able to apply some of the more advanced algorithms that Drake provides.  Of
    course, I think that you should use Drake for your work in RL, too (many
    people do), because it provides the rich library of dynamical systems that
    are rigorously authored and tested, and leaves open the option to put RL
    approaches head-to-head against more model-based alternatives. I admit I
    might be a little biased. At any rate, that's the approach we will take in
    these notes.</p>
    
    <p>Some people <a
    href="http://www.incompleteideas.net/IncIdeas/BitterLesson.html">might
    argue</a> that the more thoughtfully you model your system, the more
    assumptions you have baked in, making yourself susceptible to "sim2real"
    gaps; but I think that's simply not the case.  Thoughtful modeling includes
    making uncertainty models that can account for as narrow or broad of a
    class of systems as we aim to explore; good things happen when we can make
    the uncertainty models themselves <i>structured</i>. I think one of the
    most fundamental challenges waiting for us at the intersection of
    reinforcement learning and control deeper understanding of the class of
    models that is rich enough to describe the diversity and richness of
    problems we are exploring in manipulation (e.g. with RGB cameras as inputs)
    while providing somewhat more structure that we can exploit with stronger
    algorithms and still allowing them to continually expand and improve with
    data.</p>  <todo>callout to intuitive physics chapter once it exists</todo>

    <!-- another point: the RL approach has been successful in part because
    it's easy.  approachable with less training, and as a result got more
    people/funding put against it. that's super valuable.  controls as a field,
    on the other hand, has made itself somewhat intentionally obscure, perhaps
    partly out of arrogance.  that is perhaps the more bitter lesson.  -->

    <p>The OpenAI Gym provides an interface for RL environments, but doesn't
    provide the implementation of the actual RL algorithms.  There are a large
    number of popular repositories for the algorithms, too.  As of this
    writing, I would recommend <a
    href="https://stable-baselines3.readthedocs.io/en/master/index.html">Stable
    Baselines 3</a>: it provides a very nice and thoughfully-documented set of
    implementations in PyTorch.</p>

    <!--
      - the env interface is now standard, but the policy interface is not.
        everyone rolls their own, and mostly assumes nn.Module as a base class.
      - SB3 lets you define a custom "policy" (actually policy + value func),
        but doesn't currently support dynamic policies (LSTM was removed at
        some point; hopefully it will come back)
      - I really dislike that the notion of value function and Q function are
        applied directly to observations.  (In SB3, but most other packages,
        too).  That's bad form.
      -->


    <p>One other class of algorithms that is very relevant to RL but not
    specifically designed for RL is algorithms for black-box optimization.  I
    quite like <a
    href="https://facebookresearch.github.io/nevergrad/">Nevergrad</a>, and
    will also use that here.</p>

    <!-- We have some relevant nevergrad <=> drake (e.g. mathematicalprogram)
        code in anzu. -->

      <p>This is a great time for theoretical RL + controls, with experts from
      controls embracing new techniques and insights from machine learning, and
      vice versa.  As a simple example, we've increasingly come to understand
      that, even though the cost landscape for many classical control problems
      (like the linear quadratic regulator) is not convex in the typical policy
      parameters, we <a
      href="http://underactuated.csail.mit.edu/policy_search.html">now
      understand that gradient descent still works</a> for these problems
      (there are no local minima), and the class of problems/parameterizations
      for which we can make statements like this is growing rapidly.</p>
